# Hooking Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **T1179 — Hooking**

Windows processes often leverage application programming interface (API) functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions. Hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via: * **Hooks procedures**, which intercept and execute designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse inputs. * **Import address table (IAT) hooking**, which use modifications to a process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored. * **Inline hooking**, which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow. Similar to Process Injection, adversaries may use hooking to load and execute malicious code within the context of another process, masking the execution while also allowing access to the process's memory and possibly elevated privileges. Installing hooking mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation when the functions are called through normal use. Malicious hooking mechanisms may also capture API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials for Credential Access. Hooking is commonly utilized by Rootkits to conceal files, processes, Registry keys, and other objects in order to hide malware and associated behaviors.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
