# Group Enumeration Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0099 — Group Enumeration**

Extracting group lists from identity systems identifies permissions, roles, or configurations. Adversaries may exploit high-privilege groups or misconfigurations. Examples: - AWS CLI: `aws iam list-groups` - PowerShell: `Get-ADGroup -Filter *` - (Saas) Google Workspace: Admin SDK Directory API - Azure: `Get-AzureADGroup` - Microsoft 365: Graph API `GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups` *Data Collection Measures:* - Cloud Logging: Enable AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, and Google Workspace Admin Logs for group-related actions. - Directory Monitoring: Track logs like AD Event ID 4662 (object operations). - API Monitoring: Log API activity like AWS IAM queries. - SaaS Monitoring: Use platform logs (e.g., Office 365 Unified Audit Logs). - SIEM Integration: Centralize group query tracking.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
