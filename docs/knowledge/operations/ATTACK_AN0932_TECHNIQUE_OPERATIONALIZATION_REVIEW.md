# Analytic 0932 Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0932 — Analytic 0932**

Execution of CMSTP.exe with arguments pointing to suspicious or remote INF/SCT/DLL payloads, optionally followed by outbound network connections to untrusted IPs, process injection via COM interfaces (CMSTPLUA, CMLUAUTIL), registry modifications registering malicious profiles, or creation of suspicious INF/DLL/SCT files prior to execution.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
