# Drive Modification Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0046 — Drive Modification**

The alteration of a drive letter, mount point, or other attributes of a data storage device, which could involve reassignment, renaming, permissions changes, or other modifications. Examples: - Drive Letter Reassignment: A USB drive previously assigned `E:\` is reassigned to `D:\` on a Windows machine. - Mount Point Change: On a Linux system, a mounted storage device at `/mnt/external` is moved to `/mnt/storage`. - Drive Permission Changes: A shared drive's permissions are modified to allow write access for unauthorized users or processes. - Renaming of a Drive: A network drive labeled "HR_Share" is renamed to "Shared_Resources." - Modification of Cloud-Integrated Drives: A cloud storage mount such as Google Drive is modified to sync only specific folders. This data component can be collected through the following measures: Windows Event Logs - Relevant Events: - Event ID 98: Indicates changes to a volume (e.g., drive letter reassignment). - Event ID 1006: Logs permission modifications or changes to removable storage. - Configuration: Enable "Storage Operational Logs" in the Event Viewer: `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Storage-Tiering > Operational` Linux System Logs - Auditd Configuration: Add audit rules to track changes to mounted drives: `auditctl -w /mnt/ -p w -k drive_modification` - Command-Line Monitoring: Use `dmesg` or `journalctl` to observe drive modifications. macOS System Logs - Unified Logs: Collect mount or drive modification events: `log show --info | grep "Volume modified"` - Command-Line Monitoring: Use `diskutil` to track changes: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools - Configure policies in EDR solutions to monitor and log changes to drive configurations or attributes. SIEM Tools - Aggregate logs from multiple systems into a centralized platform like Splunk to correlate events and alert on suspicious drive modification activities.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
