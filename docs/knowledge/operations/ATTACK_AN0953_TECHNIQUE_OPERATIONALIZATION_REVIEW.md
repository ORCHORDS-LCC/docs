# Analytic 0953 Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0953 — Analytic 0953**

Defenders can detect suspicious reversion of cloud compute instances by monitoring for unusual snapshot restores, rollback actions, or ephemeral storage resets that occur outside expected administrative workflows. From a defender’s perspective, relevant detection chains include: a snapshot restore triggered by a new or rarely used account, a sequence of snapshot creation immediately followed by a restore and instance start, or rollbacks performed from anomalous geographic or network locations. These patterns may indicate attempts to remove forensic evidence or re-establish a clean execution state for persistence.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
