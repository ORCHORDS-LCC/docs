# Cloud Service Metadata Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0070 — Cloud Service Metadata**

Cloud service metadata refers to the contextual and descriptive information about cloud services, including their name, type, purpose, configuration, and activity around them. This metadata is essential for understanding the roles and functions of cloud services, their operational status, and their potential misuse. Examples: - Azure Service Metadata: Metadata describing a resource in Azure, such as an Azure Storage Account or a Virtual Machine. - AWS Cloud Service Metadata: Metadata for an AWS EC2 instance collected using the `DescribeInstances` API call. - Google Cloud Service Metadata: Metadata for a Google Compute Engine instance collected using `gcloud compute instances describe`. - Office 365 Metadata: Metadata about an Office 365 SharePoint site.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
