# Active Directory Object Access Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0071 — Active Directory Object Access**

Object access refers to activities where AD objects (e.g., user accounts, groups, policies) are accessed or queried. Example: Windows Event ID 4661 logs object access attempts. Examples: - Attribute Access: e.g., `userPassword`, `memberOf`, `securityDescriptor`. - Group Enumeration: Enumerating critical group members (e.g., Domain Admins). - User Attributes: Commonly accessed attributes like `samAccountName`, `lastLogonTimestamp`. - Policy Access: Accessing GPOs to understand security settings. *Data Collection Measures:* - Audit Policies: - Enable "Audit Directory Service Access" under Advanced Audit Policies (Success and Failure). - Path: `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Audit Policies > Object AccessEnable: Audit Directory Service Access` (Success and Failure). - Captured Events: IDs 4661, 4662. - Event Forwarding: Use WEF to centralize logs for SIEM analysis. - SIEM Integration: Collect and parse logs (e.g., 4661, 4662) using tools like Splunk or Azure Sentinel. - Log Filtering: - Focus on sensitive objects/attributes like: - `Domain Admins` group. - `userPassword`, `ntSecurityDescriptor`. - Enable EDR Monitoring: - Detect processes accessing sensitive AD objects (e.g., samAccountName, securityDescriptor). - Log all attempts to enumerate critical groups (e.g., "Domain Admins").

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
