# DLL Search Order Hijacking Mitigation Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **T1038 — DLL Search Order Hijacking Mitigation**

Disallow loading of remote DLLs. This is included by default in Windows Server 2012+ and is available by patch for XP+ and Server 2003+. Path Algorithm Enable Safe DLL Search Mode to force search for system DLLs in directories with greater restrictions (e.g. <code>%SYSTEMROOT%</code>)to be used before local directory DLLs (e.g. a user's home directory). The Safe DLL Search Mode can be enabled via Group Policy at Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Administrative Templates > MSS (Legacy): MSS: (SafeDllSearchMode) Enable Safe DLL search mode. The associated Windows Registry key for this is located at <code>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SafeDLLSearchMode</code> Use auditing tools capable of detecting DLL search order hijacking opportunities on systems within an enterprise and correct them. Toolkits like the PowerSploit framework contain PowerUp modules that can be used to explore systems for DLL hijacking weaknesses. Identify and block potentially malicious software that may be executed through search order hijacking by using whitelisting tools like AppLocker that are capable of auditing and/or blocking unknown DLLs.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
