# Analytic 1982 Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1982 — Analytic 1982**

Consider use of services that may aid in the tracking of newly issued certificates and/or certificates in use on sites across the Internet. In some cases it may be possible to pivot on known pieces of certificate information to uncover other adversary infrastructure. Some server-side components of adversary tools may have default values set for SSL/TLS certificates. Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Defense Evasion or Command and Control. Monitor for contextual data about a malicious payload, such as compilation times, file hashes, as well as watermarks or other identifiable configuration information. Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Defense Evasion or Command and Control. Monitor for logged network traffic in response to a scan showing both protocol header and body values that may buy and/or steal capabilities that can be used during targeting. Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Defense Evasion or Command and Control. Consider analyzing malware for features that may be associated with malware providers, such as compiler used, debugging artifacts, code similarities, or even group identifiers associated with specific Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offerings. Malware repositories can also be used to identify additional samples associated with the developers and the adversary utilizing their services. Identifying overlaps in malware use by different adversaries may indicate malware was obtained by the adversary rather than developed by them. In some cases, identifying overlapping characteristics in malware used by different adversaries may point to a shared quartermaster. Malware repositories can also be used to identify features of tool use associated with an adversary, such as watermarks in Cobalt Strike payloads.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
