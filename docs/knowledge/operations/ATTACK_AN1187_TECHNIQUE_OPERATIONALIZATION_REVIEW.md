# Analytic 1187 Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1187 — Analytic 1187**

Detection focuses on correlating snapshot creation events with subsequent instance creation and mounting activities. From a defender perspective, suspicious sequences include snapshot creation by unexpected or newly created IAM users, snapshots created from sensitive volumes without preceding change-control activity, or snapshots immediately followed by mounting to unauthorized instances. Cross-referencing with user behavior, IP geolocation, and automation context helps distinguish benign backup operations from adversary-driven snapshot exploitation.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
