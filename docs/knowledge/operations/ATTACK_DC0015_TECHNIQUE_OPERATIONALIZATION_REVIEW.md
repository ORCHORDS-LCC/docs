# Image Creation Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0015 — Image Creation**

Initial construction of a virtual machine image within a cloud environment. Virtual machine images are templates containing an operating system and installed applications, which can be deployed to create new virtual machines. Monitoring the creation of these images is important because adversaries may create custom images to include malicious software or misconfigurations for later exploitation. Examples: - Azure Compute Service Image Creation - Example: Creating a virtual machine image in Azure using Azure CLI: `az image create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyImage --source MyVM` - AWS EC2 AMI (Amazon Machine Image) Creation - Example: Creating an AMI from an EC2 instance: `aws ec2 create-image --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --name "MyAMI" --description "An AMI for my app"` - Google Cloud Compute Engine Image Creation - Example: Creating a custom image using gcloud: `gcloud compute images create my-custom-image --source-disk my-disk --source-disk-zone us-central1-a` - VMware vSphere - Example: Exporting a VM to create an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) template: This could later be imported into other environments with potential tampering.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
