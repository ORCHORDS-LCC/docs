# Disable Crypto Hardware Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **T1600.002 — Disable Crypto Hardware**

Adversaries disable a network device’s dedicated hardware encryption, which may enable them to leverage weaknesses in software encryption in order to reduce the effort involved in collecting, manipulating, and exfiltrating transmitted data. Many network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls, perform encryption on network traffic to secure transmission across networks. Often, these devices are equipped with special, dedicated encryption hardware to greatly increase the speed of the encryption process as well as to prevent malicious tampering. When an adversary takes control of such a device, they may disable the dedicated hardware, for example, through use of Modify System Image, forcing the use of software to perform encryption on general processors. This is typically used in conjunction with attacks to weaken the strength of the cipher in software (e.g., Reduce Key Space).

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
