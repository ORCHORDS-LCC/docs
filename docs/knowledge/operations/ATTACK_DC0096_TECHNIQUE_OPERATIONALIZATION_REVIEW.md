# Passive DNS Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0096 — Passive DNS**

"Domain Name: Passive DNS" captures logged historical and real-time domain name system (DNS) data. This includes records of domain-to-IP address resolutions over time, enabling analysts to track the evolution of domain infrastructure, uncover historical patterns of use, and detect malicious activities tied to domains and their associated IP addresses. Examples: - Historical Resolutions - Shared IP Usage - Temporal Patterns - Malicious Domain Clustering - Historical Lookback This data component can be collected through the following measures: - Passive DNS Platforms: Use platforms that specialize in passive DNS collection and analysis: - Tools: Farsight DNSDB, RiskIQ PassiveTotal, PassiveDNS. - Threat Intelligence Feeds: Integrate passive DNS data from commercial or open-source threat intelligence providers. - Custom DNS Collectors: Deploy custom tools to capture DNS traffic at the network level for analysis. - Cloud DNS Services: Leverage cloud DNS services (e.g., AWS Route 53, Azure DNS) that maintain DNS query logs.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
