# Container Start Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0077 — Container Start**

"Container Start" data component captures events related to the activation or invocation of a container within a containerized environment. This includes starting a previously stopped container, restarting an existing container, or initializing a container for runtime. Monitoring these activities is critical for identifying unauthorized or unexpected container activations, which may indicate potential adversarial activity or misconfigurations. Examples: - Docker Example: `docker start <container_name>`, `docker restart <container_name>` - Kubernetes Example: Kubernetes automatically restarts containers as part of pod lifecycle management (e.g., due to health checks or configuration changes). - Cloud-Native Example - AWS ECS: API Call: StartTask to activate a stopped ECS task. - Azure Container Instances: Command to restart a container group instance. - GCP Kubernetes Engine: Automatic restarts as part of node or pod management. This data component can be collected through the following measures: - Docker Audit Logging: Enable Docker logging to capture start and restart events. Use tools like auditd to monitor terminal activity involving container lifecycle commands. - Kubernetes Audit Logs: Enable Kubernetes API server audit logging. - Cloud Provider Logs - AWS CloudTrail: Capture StartTask or related API calls for ECS. - Azure Monitor: Track activity in container groups that indicate start or restart events. - GCP Cloud Logging: Record logs related to pod restarts or scaling events in Kubernetes Engine. - SIEM Integration: Collect logs from Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud services to correlate container start events.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
