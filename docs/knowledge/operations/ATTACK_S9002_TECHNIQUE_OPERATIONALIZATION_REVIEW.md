# Diskpart Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **S9002 — Diskpart**

Diskpart is a Windows command-line utility that is used to manage the computer’s drives, which includes disks, partitions, volumes and virtual hard disks. Adversaries may abuse Diskpart to perform discovery and destructive actions on a system’s storage. For example, adversaries have been observed using Diskpart to conduct Discovery techniques to enumerate disks and volumes to gather information about the host environment, and to execute commands such as `clean all` to remove partition information and overwrite data across disks, resulting in data destruction.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
