# Analytic 0681 Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0681 — Analytic 0681**

Defenders may observe attempts to alter cryptographic settings on network devices that reduce key strength or allowable cipher suites. Suspicious indicators include configuration changes that downgrade encryption algorithms, key length parameters, or the disabling of strong encryption in favor of legacy ciphers. These activities often appear as CLI commands modifying crypto policies, firmware changes affecting crypto libraries, or unexpected updates to key management files. Correlation across device config logs and traffic analysis showing weaker ciphers provides higher confidence of malicious key space reduction.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
