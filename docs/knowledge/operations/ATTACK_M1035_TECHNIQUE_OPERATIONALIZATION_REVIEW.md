# Limit Access to Resource Over Network Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **M1035 — Limit Access to Resource Over Network**

Restrict access to network resources, such as file shares, remote systems, and services, to only those users, accounts, or systems with a legitimate business requirement. This can include employing technologies like network concentrators, RDP gateways, and zero-trust network access (ZTNA) models, alongside hardening services and protocols. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Audit and Restrict Access: - Regularly audit permissions for file shares, network services, and remote access tools. - Remove unnecessary access and enforce least privilege principles for users and services. - Use Active Directory and IAM tools to restrict access based on roles and attributes. Deploy Secure Remote Access Solutions: - Use RDP gateways, VPN concentrators, and ZTNA solutions to aggregate and secure remote access connections. - Configure access controls to restrict connections based on time, device, and user identity. - Enforce MFA for all remote access mechanisms. Disable Unnecessary Services: - Identify running services using tools like netstat (Windows/Linux) or Nmap. - Disable unused services, such as Telnet, FTP, and legacy SMB, to reduce the attack surface. - Use firewall rules to block traffic on unused ports and protocols. Network Segmentation and Isolation: - Use VLANs, firewalls, or micro-segmentation to isolate critical network resources from general access. - Restrict communication between subnets to prevent lateral movement. Monitor and Log Access: - Monitor access attempts to file shares, RDP, and remote network resources using SIEM tools. - Enable auditing and logging for successful and failed attempts to access restricted resources. *Tools for Implementation* File Share Management: - Microsoft Active Directory Group Policies - Samba (Linux/Unix file share management) - AccessEnum (Windows access auditing tool) Secure Remote Access: - Microsoft Remote Desktop Gateway - Apache Guacamole (open-source RDP/VNC gateway) - Zero Trust solutions: Tailscale, Cloudflare Zero Trust Service and Protocol Hardening: - Nmap or Nessus for network service discovery - Windows Group Policy Editor for disabling SMBv1, Telnet, and legacy protocols - iptables or firewalld (Linux) for blocking unnecessary traffic Network Segmentation: - pfSense for open-source network isolation.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
