# Driver Load Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0079 — Driver Load**

The process of attaching a driver, which is a software component that allows the operating system and applications to interact with hardware devices, to either user-mode or kernel-mode of a system. This can include benign actions (e.g., hardware drivers) or malicious behavior (e.g., rootkits or unsigned drivers). Examples: - Legitimate Driver Loading: A new graphics driver from a vendor like NVIDIA or AMD is loaded into the system. - Unsigned Driver Loading: A driver without a valid digital signature is loaded into the kernel. - Rootkit Installation: A malicious rootkit driver is loaded to manipulate kernel-mode processes. - Anti-Virus or EDR Driver Loading: An Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution loads its driver to monitor system activities. - Driver Misuse: A legitimate driver is loaded and exploited to execute malicious actions, such as using vulnerable drivers for bypassing defenses (e.g., Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks).

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
