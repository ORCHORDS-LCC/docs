# Cloud Storage Metadata Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0027 — Cloud Storage Metadata**

Cloud Storage Metadata provides contextual information about cloud storage infrastructure and its associated activity. This data may include attributes such as storage name, size, owner, permissions, creation date, region, and activity metadata. It is essential for monitoring, auditing, and identifying anomalies in cloud storage environments. Examples: - AWS S3 Bucket Metadata: Metadata about an S3 bucket includes the bucket name, region, creation date, owner, storage class, and permissions. - Azure Blob Storage Metadata: Metadata for an Azure Blob container includes container name, access level (e.g., private or public), size, and tags. - Google Cloud Storage Metadata: Metadata includes bucket name, storage class, location, labels, lifecycle policies, and versioning status. - OpenStack Swift Metadata: Metadata for a Swift container includes name, access level, quota, and custom attributes.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
