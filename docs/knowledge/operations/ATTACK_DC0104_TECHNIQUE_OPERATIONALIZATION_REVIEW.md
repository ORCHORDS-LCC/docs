# Response Content Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0104 — Response Content**

Captured network traffic that provides details about responses received during an internet scan. This data includes both protocol header values (e.g., HTTP status codes, IP headers, or DNS response codes) and response body content (e.g., HTML, JSON, or raw data). Examples: - HTTP Scan: A web server responds to a probe with an HTTP 200 status code and an HTML body indicating the default page is accessible. - DNS Scan: A DNS server replies to a query with a resolved IP address for a domain, along with details like Time-To-Live (TTL) and authoritative information. - TCP Banner Grab: A service listening on a port (e.g., SSH or FTP) responds with a banner containing service name, version, or other metadata.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
