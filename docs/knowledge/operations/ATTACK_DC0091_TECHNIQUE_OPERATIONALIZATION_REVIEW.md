# Container Enumeration Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0091 — Container Enumeration**

"Container Enumeration" data component captures events and actions related to listing and identifying active or available containers within a containerized environment. This includes information about running, stopped, or configured containers, such as their names, IDs, statuses, or associated images. Monitoring this activity is crucial for detecting unauthorized discovery or reconnaissance efforts. Examples: - Docker Example: `docker ps`, `docker ps -a` - Kubernetes Example: `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl get deployments` - Cloud Container Services Example - AWS ECS: API Call: ListTasks or ListContainers - Azure Kubernetes Service: API Call: List pod or container instances. - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): API Call: Retrieve deployments and their associated containers.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
