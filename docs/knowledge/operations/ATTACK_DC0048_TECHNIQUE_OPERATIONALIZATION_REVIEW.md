# Named Pipe Metadata Technique Operationalization Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0048 — Named Pipe Metadata**

Contextual data about a named pipe on a system, including pipe name and creating process (ex: Sysmon EIDs 17-18) *Data Collection Measures:* - Windows: - Sysmon Event ID 17: Logs the creation of a named pipe. - Sysmon Event ID 18: Logs connection attempts to a named pipe. - Windows Security Event ID 5145: Logs access attempts to named pipes via SMB shares. - ETW (Event Tracing for Windows): Provides deep telemetry into named pipe interactions. - Linux/macOS: - AuditD (`mkfifo`, `open`, `read`, `write` syscalls): Tracks FIFO (named pipe) creation and usage. - Lsof (`lsof -p <PID>` or `lsof | grep PIPE`): Lists active named pipes and associated processes. - Strace (`strace -e open <process>`): Monitors named pipe interactions. - Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR): - Capture named pipe events as part of process tracking. - Memory Forensics: - Volatility Plugin (`pipescan`): Enumerates named pipes in system memory. - Rekall Framework: Identifies active named pipes and associated processes.

## Operationalization review

1. Record the operational scope: which services, environments, and data the technique could affect.
2. Record the runbook that would be executed, and its owner.
3. Record the telemetry the runbook depends on, and whether it is retained long enough to investigate.
4. Record the detection that would surface the technique before or after it has an effect.
5. Record the recovery path, and the evidence that recovery has been rehearsed.
6. Record the residual operational risk where the runbook depends on a manual step.

## Review evidence

- the runbook and its owner;
- the telemetry retention and coverage record;
- the detection mapping;
- the exercise or rehearsal record.

## Limitations

An operationalization review describes the runbook and the evidence around it. It does not claim the technique has been prevented or detected in a live environment.
