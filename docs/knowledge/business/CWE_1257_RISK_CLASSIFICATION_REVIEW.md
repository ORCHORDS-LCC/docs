# Improper Access Control Applied to Mirrored or Aliased Memory Regions Risk Classification Review

## Reference

- Weakness: **1257 — Improper Access Control Applied to Mirrored or Aliased Memory Regions**
- Abstraction: Base
- Status: Incomplete

## Weakness description

Aliased or mirrored memory regions in hardware designs may have inconsistent read/write permissions enforced by the hardware. A possible result is that an untrusted agent is blocked from accessing a memory region but is not blocked from accessing the corresponding aliased memory region.

## Risk classification review

1. Record whether the weakness class is relevant to the systems and data in scope, and the reason.
2. Record the business impact if the weakness class were present and exploited, in terms of the affected capability.

4. Record the classification and the criteria it was measured against.
5. Record the treatment: remediate, mitigate, transfer, or accept, with the owner.
6. Record the review trigger for the classification.
