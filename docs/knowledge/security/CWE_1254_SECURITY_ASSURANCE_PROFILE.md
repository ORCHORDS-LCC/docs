# Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity Security Assurance Profile

## Reference

- Weakness: **1254 — Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity**
- Abstraction: Base
- Status: Draft

## Weakness description

The product's comparison logic is performed over a series of steps rather than across the entire string in one operation. If there is a comparison logic failure on one of these steps, the operation may be vulnerable to a timing attack that can result in the interception of the process for nefarious purposes.

## Assurance profile

1. Confirm whether the weakness is present in the systems in scope, and record the method used to determine that.
2. Review the weakness's related weaknesses to understand the chain it participates in.
3. Determine which code, configuration, or design element could introduce the weakness.
4. Define the verification method: static analysis, dynamic testing, code review, or configuration inspection.
5. Record the evidence that would show the weakness is absent or remediated.
6. Track the weakness's status and re-check when the catalog is revised.

## Verification evidence

- a scope statement naming the systems examined;
- the verification method and its date;
- findings linked to the specific weakness identifier;
- a remediation or mitigation record for each finding;
- a residual-risk acceptance where remediation is deferred.

## Limitations

A weakness entry describes a class of weakness. Its presence in a system is a property of that system, established only by verification evidence.
