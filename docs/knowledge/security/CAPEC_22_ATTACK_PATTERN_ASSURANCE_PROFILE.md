# Exploiting Trust in Client Attack Pattern Assurance Profile

## Reference

- Attack pattern: **22 — Exploiting Trust in Client**
- Status: Draft

## Pattern description

An attack of this type exploits vulnerabilities in client/server communication channel authentication and data integrity. It leverages the implicit trust a server places in the client, or more importantly, that which the server believes is the client. An attacker executes this type of attack by communicating directly with the server where the server believes it is communicating only with a valid client. There are numerous variations of this type of attack.

## Assurance profile

1. Determine whether the attack pattern is in scope for the systems and data being protected, and record the reason.
2. Review the pattern's prerequisites: the access, position, or precondition it requires.
3. Identify the observable indicators the pattern would produce in logs, telemetry, or configuration.
4. Define the control that prevents the pattern and the control that would detect it.
5. Define the verification method and the evidence that would demonstrate either prevention or detection.
6. Record the residual risk where only detection, not prevention, can be achieved.

## Verification evidence

- a scope decision recording why the pattern is or is not applicable;
- the indicator list mapped to the telemetry that would carry it;
- the control mapping with the evidence that supports it;
- a test or exercise record for the detection path.

## Limitations

An attack-pattern entry describes a class of abuse. Applicability and exposure are properties of a system, established only by evidence.
