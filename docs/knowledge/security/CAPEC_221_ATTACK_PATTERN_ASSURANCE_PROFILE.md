# Data Serialization External Entities Blowup Attack Pattern Assurance Profile

## Reference

- Attack pattern: **221 — Data Serialization External Entities Blowup**
- Status: Draft

## Pattern description

This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of certain data serialization languages (e.g., XML, YAML, etc.) where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted file could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI.

## Assurance profile

1. Determine whether the attack pattern is in scope for the systems and data being protected, and record the reason.
2. Review the pattern's prerequisites: the access, position, or precondition it requires.
3. Identify the observable indicators the pattern would produce in logs, telemetry, or configuration.
4. Define the control that prevents the pattern and the control that would detect it.
5. Define the verification method and the evidence that would demonstrate either prevention or detection.
6. Record the residual risk where only detection, not prevention, can be achieved.

## Verification evidence

- a scope decision recording why the pattern is or is not applicable;
- the indicator list mapped to the telemetry that would carry it;
- the control mapping with the evidence that supports it;
- a test or exercise record for the detection path.

## Limitations

An attack-pattern entry describes a class of abuse. Applicability and exposure are properties of a system, established only by evidence.
