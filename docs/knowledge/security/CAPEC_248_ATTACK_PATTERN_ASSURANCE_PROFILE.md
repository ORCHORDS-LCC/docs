# Command Injection Attack Pattern Assurance Profile

## Reference

- Attack pattern: **248 — Command Injection**
- Status: Stable

## Pattern description

An adversary looking to execute a command of their choosing, injects new items into an existing command thus modifying interpretation away from what was intended. Commands in this context are often standalone strings that are interpreted by a downstream component and cause specific responses. This type of attack is possible when untrusted values are used to build these command strings. Weaknesses in input validation or command construction can enable the attack and lead to successful exploitation.

## Assurance profile

1. Determine whether the attack pattern is in scope for the systems and data being protected, and record the reason.
2. Review the pattern's prerequisites: the access, position, or precondition it requires.
3. Identify the observable indicators the pattern would produce in logs, telemetry, or configuration.
4. Define the control that prevents the pattern and the control that would detect it.
5. Define the verification method and the evidence that would demonstrate either prevention or detection.
6. Record the residual risk where only detection, not prevention, can be achieved.

## Verification evidence

- a scope decision recording why the pattern is or is not applicable;
- the indicator list mapped to the telemetry that would carry it;
- the control mapping with the evidence that supports it;
- a test or exercise record for the detection path.

## Limitations

An attack-pattern entry describes a class of abuse. Applicability and exposure are properties of a system, established only by evidence.
