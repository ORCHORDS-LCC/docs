# Cloud Service Disable Technique Response Playbook

## Target technique

**DC0090 — Cloud Service Disable**


This data component refers to monitoring actions that deactivate or stop a cloud service in a cloud control plane. Examples include disabling essential logging services like AWS CloudTrail (`StopLogging` API call), Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs, or Google Cloud's Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver). Disabling such services can hinder visibility into adversary activities within the cloud environment. Examples: - AWS CloudTrail StopLogging: This action stops logging of API activity for a particular trail, effectively reducing the monitoring and visibility of AWS resources and activities. - Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs: Disabling these logs hinders the organization’s ability to detect anomalous activities and trace malicious actions. - Google Cloud Logging: Disabling cloud logging removes visibility into resource activity, preventing monitoring of service access or configuration changes. - SaaS Applications: Stopping logging removes visibility into user activities, such as email access or file downloads, enabling undetected malicious behavior.

## Preconditions

- the estate in scope is identified, with the systems the technique could apply to;
- an owner is accountable for detection and response;
- current telemetry and configuration can be inspected;
- the technique is applicable or requires an applicability decision.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the scope and owner.
2. Read the current technique description and the associated detection guidance.
3. Inventory the telemetry that would carry the technique's indicators.
4. Inspect whether the indicators are present in the environment.
5. Exercise the detection path and confirm it produces the expected signal.
6. Record gaps in detection coverage and assign remediation owners.
7. Record justified non-applicability or accepted detection gaps separately.
8. Set the next event-driven or periodic verification trigger.

## Failure handling

If the detection path does not produce the expected signal, treat the coverage as unverified, preserve the test evidence, and route the gap through the appropriate remediation or risk process.

## Completion evidence

Scope, owner, source version, telemetry inspected, tests performed, findings, exceptions, remediation links, reviewer, and next trigger.
