# Command Execution Technique Response Playbook

## Target technique

**DC0064 — Command Execution**


Command Execution involves monitoring and capturing the execution of textual commands (including shell commands, cmdlets, and scripts) within an operating system or application. These commands may include arguments or parameters and are typically executed through interpreters such as `cmd.exe`, `bash`, `zsh`, `PowerShell`, or programmatic execution. Examples: - Windows Command Prompt - dir – Lists directory contents. - net user – Queries or manipulates user accounts. - tasklist – Lists running processes. - PowerShell - Get-Process – Retrieves processes running on a system. - Set-ExecutionPolicy – Changes PowerShell script execution policies. - Invoke-WebRequest – Downloads remote resources. - Linux Shell - ls – Lists files in a directory. - cat /etc/passwd – Reads the user accounts file. - curl http://malicious-site.com – Retrieves content from a malicious URL. - Container Environments - docker exec – Executes a command inside a running container. - kubectl exec – Runs commands in Kubernetes pods. - macOS Terminal - open – Opens files or URLs. - dscl . -list /Users – Lists all users on the system. - osascript -e – Executes AppleScript commands.

## Preconditions

- the estate in scope is identified, with the systems the technique could apply to;
- an owner is accountable for detection and response;
- current telemetry and configuration can be inspected;
- the technique is applicable or requires an applicability decision.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the scope and owner.
2. Read the current technique description and the associated detection guidance.
3. Inventory the telemetry that would carry the technique's indicators.
4. Inspect whether the indicators are present in the environment.
5. Exercise the detection path and confirm it produces the expected signal.
6. Record gaps in detection coverage and assign remediation owners.
7. Record justified non-applicability or accepted detection gaps separately.
8. Set the next event-driven or periodic verification trigger.

## Failure handling

If the detection path does not produce the expected signal, treat the coverage as unverified, preserve the test evidence, and route the gap through the appropriate remediation or risk process.

## Completion evidence

Scope, owner, source version, telemetry inspected, tests performed, findings, exceptions, remediation links, reviewer, and next trigger.
