# BITS Jobs Mitigation Technique Response Playbook

## Target technique

**T1197 — BITS Jobs Mitigation**


This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on the abuse of operating system design features. For example, disabling all BITS functionality will likely have unintended side effects, such as preventing legitimate software patching and updating. Efforts should be focused on preventing adversary tools from running earlier in the chain of activity and on identification of subsequent malicious behavior. Modify network and/or host firewall rules, as well as other network controls, to only allow legitimate BITS traffic. Consider limiting access to the BITS interface to specific users or groups. Consider reducing the default BITS job lifetime in Group Policy or by editing the <code>JobInactivityTimeout</code> and <code>MaxDownloadTime</code> Registry values in <code> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\BITS</code>.

## Preconditions

- the estate in scope is identified, with the systems the technique could apply to;
- an owner is accountable for detection and response;
- current telemetry and configuration can be inspected;
- the technique is applicable or requires an applicability decision.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the scope and owner.
2. Read the current technique description and the associated detection guidance.
3. Inventory the telemetry that would carry the technique's indicators.
4. Inspect whether the indicators are present in the environment.
5. Exercise the detection path and confirm it produces the expected signal.
6. Record gaps in detection coverage and assign remediation owners.
7. Record justified non-applicability or accepted detection gaps separately.
8. Set the next event-driven or periodic verification trigger.

## Failure handling

If the detection path does not produce the expected signal, treat the coverage as unverified, preserve the test evidence, and route the gap through the appropriate remediation or risk process.

## Completion evidence

Scope, owner, source version, telemetry inspected, tests performed, findings, exceptions, remediation links, reviewer, and next trigger.
