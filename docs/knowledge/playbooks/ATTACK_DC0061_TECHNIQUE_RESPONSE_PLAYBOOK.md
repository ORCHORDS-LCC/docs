# File Modification Technique Response Playbook

## Target technique

**DC0061 — File Modification**


Changes made to a file, including updates to its contents, metadata, access permissions, or attributes. These modifications may indicate legitimate activity (e.g., software updates) or unauthorized changes (e.g., tampering, ransomware, or adversarial modifications). Examples: - Content Modifications: Changes to the content of a configuration file, such as modifying `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on Linux or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows. - Permission Changes: Altering file permissions to allow broader access, such as changing a file from `644` to `777` on Linux or modifying NTFS permissions on Windows. - Attribute Modifications: Changing a file's attributes to hidden, read-only, or system on Windows. - Timestamp Manipulation: Adjusting a file's creation or modification timestamp using tools like `touch` in Linux or timestomping tools on Windows. - Software or System File Changes: Modifying system files such as `boot.ini`, kernel modules, or application binaries.

## Preconditions

- the estate in scope is identified, with the systems the technique could apply to;
- an owner is accountable for detection and response;
- current telemetry and configuration can be inspected;
- the technique is applicable or requires an applicability decision.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the scope and owner.
2. Read the current technique description and the associated detection guidance.
3. Inventory the telemetry that would carry the technique's indicators.
4. Inspect whether the indicators are present in the environment.
5. Exercise the detection path and confirm it produces the expected signal.
6. Record gaps in detection coverage and assign remediation owners.
7. Record justified non-applicability or accepted detection gaps separately.
8. Set the next event-driven or periodic verification trigger.

## Failure handling

If the detection path does not produce the expected signal, treat the coverage as unverified, preserve the test evidence, and route the gap through the appropriate remediation or risk process.

## Completion evidence

Scope, owner, source version, telemetry inspected, tests performed, findings, exceptions, remediation links, reviewer, and next trigger.
