# User Execution Mitigation Technique Response Playbook

## Target technique

**T1204 — User Execution Mitigation**


Use user training as a way to bring awareness to common phishing and spearphishing techniques and how to raise suspicion for potentially malicious events. Application whitelisting may be able to prevent the running of executables masquerading as other files. If a link is being visited by a user, block unknown or unused files in transit by default that should not be downloaded or by policy from suspicious sites as a best practice to prevent some vectors, such as .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, .cpl, etc. Some download scanning devices can open and analyze compressed and encrypted formats, such as zip and RAR that may be used to conceal malicious files in Obfuscated Files or Information. If a link is being visited by a user, network intrusion prevention systems and systems designed to scan and remove malicious downloads can be used to block activity. Solutions can be signature and behavior based, but adversaries may construct files in a way to avoid these systems.

## Preconditions

- the estate in scope is identified, with the systems the technique could apply to;
- an owner is accountable for detection and response;
- current telemetry and configuration can be inspected;
- the technique is applicable or requires an applicability decision.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the scope and owner.
2. Read the current technique description and the associated detection guidance.
3. Inventory the telemetry that would carry the technique's indicators.
4. Inspect whether the indicators are present in the environment.
5. Exercise the detection path and confirm it produces the expected signal.
6. Record gaps in detection coverage and assign remediation owners.
7. Record justified non-applicability or accepted detection gaps separately.
8. Set the next event-driven or periodic verification trigger.

## Failure handling

If the detection path does not produce the expected signal, treat the coverage as unverified, preserve the test evidence, and route the gap through the appropriate remediation or risk process.

## Completion evidence

Scope, owner, source version, telemetry inspected, tests performed, findings, exceptions, remediation links, reviewer, and next trigger.
