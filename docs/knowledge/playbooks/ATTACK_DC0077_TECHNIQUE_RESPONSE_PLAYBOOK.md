# Container Start Technique Response Playbook

## Target technique

**DC0077 — Container Start**


"Container Start" data component captures events related to the activation or invocation of a container within a containerized environment. This includes starting a previously stopped container, restarting an existing container, or initializing a container for runtime. Monitoring these activities is critical for identifying unauthorized or unexpected container activations, which may indicate potential adversarial activity or misconfigurations. Examples: - Docker Example: `docker start <container_name>`, `docker restart <container_name>` - Kubernetes Example: Kubernetes automatically restarts containers as part of pod lifecycle management (e.g., due to health checks or configuration changes). - Cloud-Native Example - AWS ECS: API Call: StartTask to activate a stopped ECS task. - Azure Container Instances: Command to restart a container group instance. - GCP Kubernetes Engine: Automatic restarts as part of node or pod management. This data component can be collected through the following measures: - Docker Audit Logging: Enable Docker logging to capture start and restart events. Use tools like auditd to monitor terminal activity involving container lifecycle commands. - Kubernetes Audit Logs: Enable Kubernetes API server audit logging. - Cloud Provider Logs - AWS CloudTrail: Capture StartTask or related API calls for ECS. - Azure Monitor: Track activity in container groups that indicate start or restart events. - GCP Cloud Logging: Record logs related to pod restarts or scaling events in Kubernetes Engine. - SIEM Integration: Collect logs from Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud services to correlate container start events.

## Preconditions

- the estate in scope is identified, with the systems the technique could apply to;
- an owner is accountable for detection and response;
- current telemetry and configuration can be inspected;
- the technique is applicable or requires an applicability decision.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the scope and owner.
2. Read the current technique description and the associated detection guidance.
3. Inventory the telemetry that would carry the technique's indicators.
4. Inspect whether the indicators are present in the environment.
5. Exercise the detection path and confirm it produces the expected signal.
6. Record gaps in detection coverage and assign remediation owners.
7. Record justified non-applicability or accepted detection gaps separately.
8. Set the next event-driven or periodic verification trigger.

## Failure handling

If the detection path does not produce the expected signal, treat the coverage as unverified, preserve the test evidence, and route the gap through the appropriate remediation or risk process.

## Completion evidence

Scope, owner, source version, telemetry inspected, tests performed, findings, exceptions, remediation links, reviewer, and next trigger.
