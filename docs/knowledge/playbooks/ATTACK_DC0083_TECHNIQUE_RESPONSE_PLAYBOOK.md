# Cloud Service Enumeration Technique Response Playbook

## Target technique

**DC0083 — Cloud Service Enumeration**


Cloud service enumeration involves listing or querying available cloud services in a cloud control plane. This activity is often performed to identify resources such as virtual machines, storage buckets, compute clusters, or other services within a cloud environment. Examples include API calls like `AWS ECS ListServices`, `Azure ListAllResources`, or `Google Cloud ListInstances`. Examples: AWS Cloud Service Enumeration: The adversary gathers details about existing ECS services to identify opportunities for privilege escalation or exfiltration. - Azure Resource Enumeration: The adversary collects information about virtual machines, resource groups, and other Azure assets for reconnaissance purposes. - Google Cloud Resource Enumeration: The attacker seeks to map the environment and find misconfigured or underutilized resources for exploitation. - Office 365 Service Enumeration: The attacker may look for data repositories or collaboration tools to exfiltrate sensitive information.

## Preconditions

- the estate in scope is identified, with the systems the technique could apply to;
- an owner is accountable for detection and response;
- current telemetry and configuration can be inspected;
- the technique is applicable or requires an applicability decision.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the scope and owner.
2. Read the current technique description and the associated detection guidance.
3. Inventory the telemetry that would carry the technique's indicators.
4. Inspect whether the indicators are present in the environment.
5. Exercise the detection path and confirm it produces the expected signal.
6. Record gaps in detection coverage and assign remediation owners.
7. Record justified non-applicability or accepted detection gaps separately.
8. Set the next event-driven or periodic verification trigger.

## Failure handling

If the detection path does not produce the expected signal, treat the coverage as unverified, preserve the test evidence, and route the gap through the appropriate remediation or risk process.

## Completion evidence

Scope, owner, source version, telemetry inspected, tests performed, findings, exceptions, remediation links, reviewer, and next trigger.
