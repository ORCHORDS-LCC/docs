# Group Metadata Technique Response Playbook

## Target technique

**DC0105 — Group Metadata**


Group metadata includes attributes like name, permissions, purpose, and associated user accounts or roles, which adversaries may exploit for privilege escalation. Examples: - Active Directory: `Get-ADGroup -Identity "Domain Admins" -Properties Members, Description` - Azure AD: `Get-AzureADGroup -ObjectId <GroupId>` - Google Workspace: `GET https://admin.googleapis.com/admin/directory/v1/groups/<groupKey>` - AWS IAM: `aws iam list-group-policies --group-name <group_name>` - Office 365: `GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/<id>` *Data Collection Measures:* - Cloud Logging: - AWS CloudTrail for IAM group-related activities. - Azure AD Sign-In/Audit logs for metadata changes. - Google Admin Activity logs for API calls. - Directory Logging: Log metadata access (e.g., Windows Event ID 4662). - API Monitoring: Log API calls to modify group metadata (e.g., Microsoft Graph API). - SIEM Integration: Centralize group metadata logs for analysis.

## Preconditions

- the estate in scope is identified, with the systems the technique could apply to;
- an owner is accountable for detection and response;
- current telemetry and configuration can be inspected;
- the technique is applicable or requires an applicability decision.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the scope and owner.
2. Read the current technique description and the associated detection guidance.
3. Inventory the telemetry that would carry the technique's indicators.
4. Inspect whether the indicators are present in the environment.
5. Exercise the detection path and confirm it produces the expected signal.
6. Record gaps in detection coverage and assign remediation owners.
7. Record justified non-applicability or accepted detection gaps separately.
8. Set the next event-driven or periodic verification trigger.

## Failure handling

If the detection path does not produce the expected signal, treat the coverage as unverified, preserve the test evidence, and route the gap through the appropriate remediation or risk process.

## Completion evidence

Scope, owner, source version, telemetry inspected, tests performed, findings, exceptions, remediation links, reviewer, and next trigger.
