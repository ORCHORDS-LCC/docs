## Target technique

**DC0106 — Response Metadata**


Contextual information about an Internet-facing resource collected during a scan, including details such as open ports, running services, protocols, and versions. This metadata is typically derived from interpreting scan results and helps build a profile of the targeted system. Examples: - Port and Service Details: - Open ports (e.g., 22, 80, 443). - Identified services running on those ports (e.g., SSH, HTTP, HTTPS). - Service Versions: Detected software version information (e.g., Apache 2.4.41, OpenSSH 8.2). - Operating System Information: OS fingerprinting data (e.g., Linux Kernel 5.4.0). - TLS/SSL Certificate Data: Information about the TLS/SSL certificate, such as the expiration date, issuer, and cipher suites. *Data Collection Measures:* - Scanning Tools: - Nmap: Collects port, service, and version information using commands like nmap -sV <IP>. - Masscan: High-speed scanning tool for discovering open ports and active services. - Zmap: Focused on large-scale Internet scanning, collecting metadata about discovered services. - Shodan API: Retrieves scan metadata for publicly exposed devices and services. - Network Logs: - Use logs from firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to gather metadata from scan attempts. Example: Zeek or Suricata logs for incoming scan traffic. - OSINT Platforms: Platforms like Censys, GreyNoise, or Shodan provide aggregated metadata about Internet-facing resources. - Cloud Metadata Services: AWS Security Hub, Azure Monitor, or GCP Security Command Center can collect and centralize scan-related metadata for Internet-facing resources in cloud environments.

## Preconditions

- the estate in scope is identified, with the systems the technique could apply to;
- an owner is accountable for detection and response;
- current telemetry and configuration can be inspected;
- the technique is applicable or requires an applicability decision.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the scope and owner.
2. Read the current technique description and the associated detection guidance.
3. Inventory the telemetry that would carry the technique's indicators.
4. Inspect whether the indicators are present in the environment.
5. Exercise the detection path and confirm it produces the expected signal.
6. Record gaps in detection coverage and assign remediation owners.
7. Record justified non-applicability or accepted detection gaps separately.
8. Set the next event-driven or periodic verification trigger.

## Failure handling

If the detection path does not produce the expected signal, treat the coverage as unverified, preserve the test evidence, and route the gap through the appropriate remediation or risk process.

## Completion evidence

Scope, owner, source version, telemetry inspected, tests performed, findings, exceptions, remediation links, reviewer, and next trigger.
