# Network Connection Creation Technique Response Playbook

## Target technique

**DC0082 — Network Connection Creation**


The initial establishment of a network session, where a system or process initiates a connection to a local or remote endpoint. This typically involves capturing socket information (source/destination IP, ports, protocol) and tracking session metadata. Monitoring these events helps detect lateral movement, exfiltration, and command-and-control (C2) activities. *Data Collection Measures:* - Windows: - Event ID 5156 – Filtering Platform Connection - Logs network connections permitted by Windows Filtering Platform (WFP). - Sysmon Event ID 3 – Network Connection Initiated - Captures process, source/destination IP, ports, and parent process. - Linux/macOS: - Netfilter (iptables), nftables logs - Tracks incoming and outgoing network connections. - AuditD (`connect` syscall) - Logs TCP, UDP, and ICMP connections. - Zeek (`conn.log`) - Captures protocol, duration, and bytes transferred. - Cloud & Network Infrastructure: - AWS VPC Flow Logs / Azure NSG Flow Logs - Logs IP traffic at the network level in cloud environments. - Zeek (conn.log) or Suricata (network events) - Captures packet metadata for detection and correlation. - Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR): - Detect anomalous network activity such as new C2 connections or data exfiltration attempts.

## Preconditions

- the estate in scope is identified, with the systems the technique could apply to;
- an owner is accountable for detection and response;
- current telemetry and configuration can be inspected;
- the technique is applicable or requires an applicability decision.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the scope and owner.
2. Read the current technique description and the associated detection guidance.
3. Inventory the telemetry that would carry the technique's indicators.
4. Inspect whether the indicators are present in the environment.
5. Exercise the detection path and confirm it produces the expected signal.
6. Record gaps in detection coverage and assign remediation owners.
7. Record justified non-applicability or accepted detection gaps separately.
8. Set the next event-driven or periodic verification trigger.

## Failure handling

If the detection path does not produce the expected signal, treat the coverage as unverified, preserve the test evidence, and route the gap through the appropriate remediation or risk process.

## Completion evidence

Scope, owner, source version, telemetry inspected, tests performed, findings, exceptions, remediation links, reviewer, and next trigger.
