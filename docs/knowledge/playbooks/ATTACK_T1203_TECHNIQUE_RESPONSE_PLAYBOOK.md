# Exploitation for Client Execution Mitigation Technique Response Playbook

## Target technique

**T1203 — Exploitation for Client Execution Mitigation**


Browser sandboxes can be used to mitigate some of the impact of exploitation, but sandbox escapes may still exist. Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of client-side exploitation. The risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in implementation may still exist. Security applications that look for behavior used during exploitation such as Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior. Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring. Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility.

## Preconditions

- the estate in scope is identified, with the systems the technique could apply to;
- an owner is accountable for detection and response;
- current telemetry and configuration can be inspected;
- the technique is applicable or requires an applicability decision.

## Procedure

1. Confirm the scope and owner.
2. Read the current technique description and the associated detection guidance.
3. Inventory the telemetry that would carry the technique's indicators.
4. Inspect whether the indicators are present in the environment.
5. Exercise the detection path and confirm it produces the expected signal.
6. Record gaps in detection coverage and assign remediation owners.
7. Record justified non-applicability or accepted detection gaps separately.
8. Set the next event-driven or periodic verification trigger.

## Failure handling

If the detection path does not produce the expected signal, treat the coverage as unverified, preserve the test evidence, and route the gap through the appropriate remediation or risk process.

## Completion evidence

Scope, owner, source version, telemetry inspected, tests performed, findings, exceptions, remediation links, reviewer, and next trigger.
