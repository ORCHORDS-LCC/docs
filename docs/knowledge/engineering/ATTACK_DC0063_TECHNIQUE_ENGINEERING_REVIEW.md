# Windows Registry Key Modification Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0063 — Windows Registry Key Modification**

Changes made to an existing registry key or its values. These modifications can include altering permissions, modifying stored data, or updating configuration settings. *Data Collection Measures:* - Windows Event Logs - Event ID 4657 - Registry Value Modified: Logs changes to registry values, including modifications to startup entries, security settings, or system configurations. - Sysmon (System Monitor) for Windows - Sysmon Event ID 13 - Registry Value Set: Captures changes to specific registry values. - Sysmon Event ID 14 - Registry Key & Value Renamed: Logs renaming of registry keys, which may indicate evasion attempts. - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions - Monitor registry modifications for suspicious behavior.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
