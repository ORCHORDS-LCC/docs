# Query Public AI Services Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **T1682 — Query Public AI Services**

Adversaries may query publicly accessible artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as large language models (LLMs), to support targeting and operations. In addition to searching websites or databases directly (i.e., Search Open Websites/Domains), adversaries may use AI services to synthesize, aggregate, and analyze publicly available information at scale. This may include identifying individuals or organizations to target, researching organizational structures and personnel, identifying technologies used by target organizations, researching business relationships to develop plausible pretexts for Social Engineering approaches, identifying contact information for use in Phishing or Phishing for Information, or gathering derogatory or sensitive information about individuals that may be used for extortion or coercion. Information gathered through AI services may be leveraged for other behaviors, such as establishing operational resources (i.e., Generate Content or Establish Accounts. For obtaining access to AI tools and services, see Artificial Intelligence.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
