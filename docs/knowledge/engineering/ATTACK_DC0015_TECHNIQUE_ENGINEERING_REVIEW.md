# Image Creation Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0015 — Image Creation**

Initial construction of a virtual machine image within a cloud environment. Virtual machine images are templates containing an operating system and installed applications, which can be deployed to create new virtual machines. Monitoring the creation of these images is important because adversaries may create custom images to include malicious software or misconfigurations for later exploitation. Examples: - Azure Compute Service Image Creation - Example: Creating a virtual machine image in Azure using Azure CLI: `az image create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyImage --source MyVM` - AWS EC2 AMI (Amazon Machine Image) Creation - Example: Creating an AMI from an EC2 instance: `aws ec2 create-image --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --name "MyAMI" --description "An AMI for my app"` - Google Cloud Compute Engine Image Creation - Example: Creating a custom image using gcloud: `gcloud compute images create my-custom-image --source-disk my-disk --source-disk-zone us-central1-a` - VMware vSphere - Example: Exporting a VM to create an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) template: This could later be imported into other environments with potential tampering.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
