# Instance Modification Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0073 — Instance Modification**

Changes made to a virtual machine (VM) or compute instance, including alterations to its configuration, metadata, attached policies, or operational state. Such modifications can include updating metadata, attaching or detaching resource policies, resizing instances, or modifying network configurations. Examples: - AWS: instance modifications include API actions like `ModifyInstanceAttribute`, `ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions`, or `RebootInstances`. - Azure: modifications can be tracked through operations like `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write`. - GCP: instance modification events include operations like `instances.setMetadata`, `instances.addResourcePolicies`, or `instances.resize`. *Data Collection Measures:* - AWS CloudTrail: Log Location: Stored in S3 or forwarded to CloudWatch. - Azure Activity Logs: Log Location: Accessible via Azure Monitor or exported to a storage account. - GCP Audit Logs: Log Location: Logs Explorer or BigQuery.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
