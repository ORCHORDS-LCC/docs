# Analytic 1621 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1621 — Analytic 1621**

Detects enabling of reversible password encryption in Active Directory or Group Policy, suspicious PowerShell commands modifying AD user properties, and unusual account configuration changes correlated with policy modifications. Multi-event correlation links Group Policy edits, PowerShell command execution, and user account property changes to identify tampering with authentication encryption settings.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
