# Volume Deletion Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0098 — Volume Deletion**

The removal of a cloud-based or on-premise block storage volume. This action permanently deletes the allocated storage and may result in data loss if not backed up. *Data Collection Measures:* - Cloud Logging & APIs - AWS CloudTrail Logs - `eventName: DeleteVolume` (tracks volume deletions) - Azure Monitor Logs - `operationName: Microsoft.Compute/disks/delete` - `status: Success | Failure` (flag unauthorized delete attempts) - Google Cloud Audit Logs - `protoPayload.methodName: "v1.compute.disks.delete"` - `authenticationInfo.principalEmail` (identifies the user deleting the volume) - System & Host-Based Logging - Linux & macOS Logs: - `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages` for volume detach/deletion actions - Windows Event Logs: - Event ID 98 (Storage Class Memory) - Event ID 225 (Volume Removal Detected) - Event ID 12 (Disk Removal Notification).

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
