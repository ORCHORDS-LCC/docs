# Analytic 1306 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1306 — Analytic 1306**

Linux environmental keying behavioral chain: (1) System information gathering through native commands (uname, hostname, id, whoami, ifconfig/ip) and file system enumeration, (2) Network configuration discovery (route tables, DNS settings, network interfaces), (3) Filesystem and mount point analysis for target-specific directories or devices, (4) Process and service enumeration to identify target-specific software, (5) Cryptographic library usage correlation with collected environmental data, (6) Payload execution following successful environmental validation.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
