# Network Device Firewall Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **T1686.002 — Network Device Firewall**

Adversaries may disable network device-based firewall mechanisms entirely or add, delete, or modify particular rules in order to bypass controls limiting network usage. Adversaries may obtain access to devices such as routers, switches, or other perimeter/network devices and change access control lists (ACLs), security zones, or policy rules to permit otherwise blocked traffic. For example, adversaries may add new network firewall rules to allow access to all internal network subnets without restrictions. Allowing access to internal network subsets may enable unrestricted inbound/outbound connectivity or open paths for command and control and lateral movement. Adversaries may obtain access to network device management interfaces via Valid Accounts or by exploiting vulnerabilities. In some cases, threat actors may target firewalls and other network infrastructure that are exposed to the internet by leveraging weaknesses in public-facing applications (Exploit Public-Facing Application). Adversaries may also modify host networking configurations that indirectly manipulate system firewalls, such as adjusting interface bandwidth or network connection request thresholds.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
