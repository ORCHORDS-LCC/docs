# Analytic 0775 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0775 — Analytic 0775**

Detection of writes to /boot or EFI directories outside of expected package manager updates. Monitoring kernel log and auditd events for attempts to overwrite bootloader binaries (e.g., grub, shim). Unexpected execution of efibootmgr or dd writing to /dev/sdX devices followed by boot parameter changes.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
