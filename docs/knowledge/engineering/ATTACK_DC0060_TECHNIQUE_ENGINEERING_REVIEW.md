# Service Creation Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0060 — Service Creation**

The registration of a new service or daemon on an operating system. *Data Collection Measures:* - Windows Event Logs - Event ID 4697 - Captures the creation of a new Windows service. - Event ID 7045 - Captures services installed by administrators or adversaries. - Event ID 7034 - Could indicate malicious service modification or exploitation. - Sysmon Logs - Sysmon Event ID 1 - Process Creation (captures service executables). - Sysmon Event ID 4 - Service state changes (detects service installation). - Sysmon Event ID 13 - Registry modifications (captures service persistence changes). - PowerShell Logging - Monitor `New-Service` and `Set-Service` PowerShell cmdlets in Event ID 4104 (Script Block Logging). - Linux/macOS Collection Methods - AuditD & Syslog Daemon Logs (`/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/daemon.log`) - AuditD Rules: - `auditctl -w /etc/systemd/system -p wa -k service_creation` - Detects changes to `systemd` service configurations. - Systemd Journals (`journalctl -u <service_name>`) - Captures newly created systemd services. - LaunchDaemons & LaunchAgents (macOS) - Monitor `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` and `/Library/LaunchAgents/` for new plist files.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
