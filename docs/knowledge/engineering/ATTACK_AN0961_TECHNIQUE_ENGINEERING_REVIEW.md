# Analytic 0961 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0961 — Analytic 0961**

Defenders may observe unauthorized modifications to encryption-related configuration files, firmware, or crypto modules on network devices. Suspicious patterns include changes to cipher suite configurations, unexpected firmware updates affecting crypto libraries, disabling of hardware cryptographic accelerators, or reductions in key length policies. Correlating configuration changes with anomalies in encrypted traffic characteristics (e.g., weaker ciphers or sudden plaintext transmission) strengthens detection.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
