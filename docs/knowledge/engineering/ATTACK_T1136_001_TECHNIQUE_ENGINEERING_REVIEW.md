# Local Account Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **T1136.001 — Local Account**

Adversaries may create a local account to maintain access to victim systems. Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service. For example, with a sufficient level of access, the Windows net user /add command can be used to create a local account. In Linux, the `useradd` command can be used, while on macOS systems, the dscl -create command can be used. Local accounts may also be added to network devices, often via common Network Device CLI commands such as username, to ESXi servers via `esxcli system account add`, or to Kubernetes clusters using the `kubectl` utility. Adversaries may also create new local accounts on network firewall management consoles – for example, by exploiting a vulnerable firewall management system, threat actors may be able to establish super-admin accounts that could be used to modify firewall rules and gain further access to the network. Such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
