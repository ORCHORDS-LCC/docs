# Resource Hijacking Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **T1496 — Resource Hijacking**

Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems to complete resource-intensive tasks, which may impact system and/or hosted service availability. Resource hijacking may take a number of different forms. For example, adversaries may: * Leverage compute resources in order to mine cryptocurrency * Sell network bandwidth to proxy networks * Generate SMS traffic for profit * Abuse cloud-based messaging services to send large quantities of spam messages In some cases, adversaries may leverage multiple types of Resource Hijacking at once.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
