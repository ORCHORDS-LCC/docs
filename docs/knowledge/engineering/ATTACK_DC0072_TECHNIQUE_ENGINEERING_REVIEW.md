# Container Creation Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0072 — Container Creation**

"Container Creation" data component captures details about the initial construction of a container in a containerized environment. This includes events where a new container is instantiated, such as through Docker, Kubernetes, or other container orchestration platforms. Monitoring these events helps detect unauthorized or potentially malicious container creation. Examples: - Docker Example: `docker create my-container`, `docker run --name=my-container nginx:latest` - Kubernetes Example: `kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx`, `kubectl create deployment my-deployment --image=nginx` - Cloud Container Services Example - AWS ECS: Task or service creation (`RunTask` or `CreateService`). - Azure Container Instances: Deployment of a container group. - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): Creation of new pods via GCP APIs.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
