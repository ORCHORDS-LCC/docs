# Code Repositories Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **T1213.003 — Code Repositories**

Adversaries may leverage code repositories to collect valuable information. Code repositories are tools/services that store source code and automate software builds. They may be hosted internally or privately on third party sites such as Github, GitLab, SourceForge, and BitBucket. Users typically interact with code repositories through a web application or command-line utilities such as git. Once adversaries gain access to a victim network or a private code repository, they may collect sensitive information such as proprietary source code or Unsecured Credentials contained within software's source code. Having access to software's source code may allow adversaries to develop Exploits, while credentials may provide access to additional resources using Valid Accounts. **Note:** This is distinct from Code Repositories, which focuses on conducting Reconnaissance via public code repositories.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
