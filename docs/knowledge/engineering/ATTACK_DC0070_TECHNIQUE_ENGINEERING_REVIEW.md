# Cloud Service Metadata Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0070 — Cloud Service Metadata**

Cloud service metadata refers to the contextual and descriptive information about cloud services, including their name, type, purpose, configuration, and activity around them. This metadata is essential for understanding the roles and functions of cloud services, their operational status, and their potential misuse. Examples: - Azure Service Metadata: Metadata describing a resource in Azure, such as an Azure Storage Account or a Virtual Machine. - AWS Cloud Service Metadata: Metadata for an AWS EC2 instance collected using the `DescribeInstances` API call. - Google Cloud Service Metadata: Metadata for a Google Compute Engine instance collected using `gcloud compute instances describe`. - Office 365 Metadata: Metadata about an Office 365 SharePoint site.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
