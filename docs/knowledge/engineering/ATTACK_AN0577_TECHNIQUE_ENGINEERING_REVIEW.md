# Analytic 0577 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0577 — Analytic 0577**

DLL hijacking behaviors including unexpected DLL loads from non-standard directories, replacement of DLLs, phantom DLL insertion, redirection file creation, and substitution of legitimate DLLs. Defender correlates file system modifications, registry changes, and module load telemetry to detect abnormal DLL behavior in trusted processes.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
