# Container Enumeration Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0091 — Container Enumeration**

"Container Enumeration" data component captures events and actions related to listing and identifying active or available containers within a containerized environment. This includes information about running, stopped, or configured containers, such as their names, IDs, statuses, or associated images. Monitoring this activity is crucial for detecting unauthorized discovery or reconnaissance efforts. Examples: - Docker Example: `docker ps`, `docker ps -a` - Kubernetes Example: `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl get deployments` - Cloud Container Services Example - AWS ECS: API Call: ListTasks or ListContainers - Azure Kubernetes Service: API Call: List pod or container instances. - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): API Call: Retrieve deployments and their associated containers.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
