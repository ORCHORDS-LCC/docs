# Analytic 1942 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1942 — Analytic 1942**

Monitor for suspicious network traffic that could be indicative of adversary reconnaissance, such as rapid successions of requests indicative of web crawling and/or large quantities of requests originating from a single source (especially if the source is known to be associated with an adversary). Analyzing web metadata may also reveal artifacts that can be attributed to potentially malicious activity, such as referer or user-agent string HTTP/S fields.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
