# Analytic 1144 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1144 — Analytic 1144**

Detects anomalous NTLM LogonType 3 authentications that occur without accompanying domain logon events, especially from lateral systems or involving built-in administrative tools. Monitors for mismatches between source user context and system being accessed. Correlates LogonSession creation, NTLM authentications, and process/service initiation to identify suspicious use of stolen password hashes for remote access or service logon without password entry. Detects overpass-the-hash by combining Kerberos ticket issuance with NTLM-based lateral movement.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
