# Analytic 0785 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0785 — Analytic 0785**

Detection focuses on identifying anomalous regsvr32.exe executions that deviate from normal administrative or system use. Defenders may observe regsvr32.exe loading scriptlets or DLLs from unusual paths (especially temporary directories or remote URLs), command-line arguments invoking /i or /u with suspicious file references, network connections initiated by regsvr32.exe, and unsigned or untrusted DLLs being loaded shortly after regsvr32.exe invocation. Correlated sequences include regsvr32.exe process creation, module load of DLL/scriptlet, and optional outbound network traffic.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
