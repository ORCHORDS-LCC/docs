# Image Metadata Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0028 — Image Metadata**

Contextual information associated with a virtual machine image, such as its name, resource group, status (active or inactive), type (custom or prebuilt), size, creation date, and permissions. This metadata is critical for understanding the state and configuration of virtual machine images in cloud environments. Examples: - Azure Compute Service Image Metadata Example: - Name: MyCustomImage - Resource Group: MyResourceGroup - State: Available - Type: Managed Image - AWS EC2 AMI Metadata Example: - Image ID: ami-1234567890abcdef0 - Name: ProdImage - State: Available - Platform: Windows - Google Cloud Compute Engine Image Metadata Example: - Image Name: webserver-image - Project: my-project-id - Family: webserver - Source Disk: my-disk-id - VMware vSphere Template Metadata Example: - Name: LinuxTemplate - Disk Size: 40GB - Network Adapter: VM Network.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
