# Pod Modification Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0030 — Pod Modification**

Changes made to a pod’s configuration or control data within a containerized cluster. This can include updating settings such as resource limits, environment variables, annotations, labels, or even the containers running within the pod. Pod modifications are often executed using commands like kubectl set, kubectl patch, or kubectl edit. *Data Collection Measures:* - Kubernetes API Server Audit Logs: - Capture all API calls related to pod modification, such as PATCH, PUT, or UPDATE methods on v1/pods. - Runtime Security Tools: - Tools like Falco, Sysdig, and Kube-bench can monitor pod modifications at runtime and alert on policy violations. - Container Orchestration Logs: - Monitor events logged by Kubernetes itself (e.g., `kubectl logs -n kube-system kube-controller-manager`). - SIEM and EDR Solutions: - Use SIEM platforms (e.g., Splunk) to aggregate API server logs and detect patterns of unauthorized or suspicious pod modifications. - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools configured with container visibility can monitor commands like `kubectl` set or `kubectl patch`. - Host-Based Monitoring: - Collect and analyze logs for processes executing `kubectl` commands or interacting with Kubernetes configuration files (e.g., `.kube/config`).

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
