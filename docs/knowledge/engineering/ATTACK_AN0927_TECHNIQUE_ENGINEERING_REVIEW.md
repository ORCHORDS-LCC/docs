# Analytic 0927 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0927 — Analytic 0927**

A process/script constructs or references a custom/alphabet translation table (e.g., 64/85/32+ arbitrary chars, XOR/base-N loops) or emits long high-entropy strings that do NOT validate as standard Base64/Hex → shortly after, the same process (or its child) generates outbound traffic with asymmetric bytes_out:bytes_in, fixed-size beacons, or protocol/header mismatches (e.g., Content-Type says JSON but body fails JSON parse / contains non-standard alphabet).

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
