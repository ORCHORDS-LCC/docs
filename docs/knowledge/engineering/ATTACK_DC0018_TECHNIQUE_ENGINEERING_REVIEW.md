# Host Status Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0018 — Host Status**

Logging, messaging, and other artifacts that highlight the health and operational state of host-based security sensors, such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, antivirus software, logging services, and system monitoring tools. Monitoring sensor health is essential for detecting misconfigurations, sensor failures, tampering, or deliberate security control evasion by adversaries. *Data Collection Measures:* - Windows Event Logs: - Event ID 1074 (System Shutdown): Detects unexpected system reboots/shutdowns. - Event ID 6006 (Event Log Stopped): Logs when Windows event logging is stopped. - Event ID 16 (Sysmon): Detects configuration state changes that may indicate log tampering. - Event ID 12 (Windows Defender Status Change) – Detects changes in Windows Defender state. - Linux/macOS Monitoring: - `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/kern.log` - Journald (journalctl) for kernel and system alerts. - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools: - Monitor agent health status, detect sensor tampering, and alert on missing telemetry. - Mobile Threat Intelligence Logs: - Samsung Knox, SafetyNet, iOS Secure Enclave provide sensor health status for mobile endpoints.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
