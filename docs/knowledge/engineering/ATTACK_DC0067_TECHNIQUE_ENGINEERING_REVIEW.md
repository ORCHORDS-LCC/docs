# Logon Session Creation Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0067 — Logon Session Creation**

The successful establishment of a new user session following a successful authentication attempt. This typically signifies that a user has provided valid credentials or authentication tokens, and the system has initiated a session associated with that user account. This data is crucial for tracking authentication events and identifying potential unauthorized access. Examples: - Windows Systems - Event ID: 4624 - Logon Type: 2 (Interactive) or 10 (Remote Interactive via RDP). - Account Name: JohnDoe - Source Network Address: 192.168.1.100 - Authentication Package: NTLM - Linux Systems - /var/log/utmp or /var/log/wtmp: - Log format: login user [tty] from [source_ip] - User: jane - IP: 10.0.0.5 - Timestamp: 2024-12-28 08:30:00 - macOS Systems - /var/log/asl.log or unified logging framework: - Log: com.apple.securityd: Authentication succeeded for user 'admin' - Cloud Environments - Azure Sign-In Logs: - Activity: Sign-in successful - Client App: Browser - Location: Unknown (Country: X) - Google Workspace - Activity: Login - Event Type: successful_login - Source IP: 203.0.113.55.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
