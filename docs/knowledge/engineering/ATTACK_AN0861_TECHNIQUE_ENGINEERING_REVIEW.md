# Analytic 0861 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0861 — Analytic 0861**

Detection focuses on identifying unauthorized or anomalous changes to compute infrastructure components. Defender perspective: monitor for creation, deletion, or modification of instances, volumes, and snapshots outside of approved change management windows; correlate abnormal activity such as rapid snapshot creation followed by new instance mounts, or repeated infrastructure changes by rarely used accounts. Flagging activity linked to unusual geolocation, API client, or automation script is suspicious.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
