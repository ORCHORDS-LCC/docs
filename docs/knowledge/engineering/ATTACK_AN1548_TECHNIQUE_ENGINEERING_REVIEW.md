# Analytic 1548 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1548 — Analytic 1548**

Adversary installs or side-loads an IDE extension (VS Code, IntelliJ/JetBrains, Eclipse) or enables IDE tunneling. Chain: (1) IDE binary starts on a non-developer endpoint or server, often with install/force/tunnel flags → (2) extension files/registrations appear under user profile → (3) browser/IDE initiates outbound connections to extension marketplaces, update endpoints, or IDE remote/tunnel services → (4) optional child tools (ssh, node, powershell) execute under the IDE context.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
