# Analytic 1360 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1360 — Analytic 1360**

Defenders may observe attempts to disable dedicated crypto hardware on network devices, often visible through anomalous CLI commands, unexpected firmware or configuration updates, and degraded encryption performance. Suspicious indicators include commands that alter hardware acceleration settings (e.g., disabling AES-NI or crypto engines), modification of system image files, or logs showing fallback from hardware to software encryption. Network traffic analysis may also reveal a sudden downgrade in throughput or cipher negotiation behavior consistent with the absence of hardware acceleration.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
