# Dynamic Data Exchange Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **T1559.002 — Dynamic Data Exchange**

Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands. DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution. Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE. Despite being superseded by Component Object Model, DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys. Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands, directly or through embedded files, and used to deliver execution via Phishing campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros. Similarly, adversaries may infect payloads to execute applications and/or commands on a victim device by way of embedding DDE formulas within a CSV file intended to be opened through a Windows spreadsheet program. DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to a Command and Scripting Interpreter. DDE execution can be invoked remotely via Remote Services such as Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM).

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
