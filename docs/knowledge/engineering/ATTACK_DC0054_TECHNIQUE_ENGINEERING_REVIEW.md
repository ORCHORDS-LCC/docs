# Drive Access Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0054 — Drive Access**

Refers to the act of accessing a data storage device, such as a hard drive, SSD, USB, or network-mounted drive. This data component logs the opening or mounting of drives, capturing activities such as reading, writing, or executing files within an assigned drive letter (e.g., `C:\`, `/mnt/drive`) or mount point. Examples: - Removable Drive Insertion: A USB drive is inserted, assigned the letter `F:\`, and files are accessed. - Network Drive Mounting: A network share `\\server\share` is mapped to the drive `Z:\`. - External Hard Drive Access: An external drive is connected, mounted at `/mnt/backup`, and accessed for copying files. - System Volume Access: The system volume `C:\` is accessed for modifications to critical files. - Cloud-Synced Drives: Cloud storage drives like OneDrive or Google Drive are accessed via local mounts.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
