# Analytic 0065 Technique Engineering Review

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0065 — Analytic 0065**

Adversary stages a lure that references a remote resource (e.g., LNK/SCF/Office template). When the user opens/renders the file or a shell enumerates icons, the host automatically attempts SMB or WebDAV authentication to the attacker host. The chain is: (1) lure file is created or modified in a user-exposed location → (2) user or system accesses the lure → (3) host makes outbound NTLM (SMB 139/445 or WebDAV over 80/443) to an untrusted destination → (4) repeated attempts from multiple users/hosts or from privileged workstations.

## Engineering review

1. Identify the engineering boundary where the technique would apply: the component, the service, or the deployment.
2. Review the design decision that would prevent the technique, and record the alternative considered.
3. Review the implementation evidence for the preventive control.
4. Review the test coverage that would fail if the control regressed.
5. Review the observability: which signal would show the control is not operating.
6. Record the residual risk where prevention is not achievable, and the detection that compensates.

## Review evidence

- the design record for the preventive decision;
- the implementation or configuration evidence;
- the test record showing the control is exercised;
- the observability mapping.

## Limitations

An engineering review describes what the design and the implementation evidence show. It does not claim the technique has been addressed in production.
