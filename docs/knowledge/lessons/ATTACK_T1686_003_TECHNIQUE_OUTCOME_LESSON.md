# T1686.003 Windows Host Firewall Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **T1686.003 — Windows Host Firewall**
- Tactics: defense-impairment
- Platforms: Windows

Adversaries may disable or modify the Windows host firewall to bypass controls limiting network usage. This can include disabling the Windows host firewall entirely, suppressing specific profiles (domain, private, public), or adding, deleting, and modifying firewall rules to allow or restrict traffic. Adversaries may perform these modifications through multiple mechanisms depending on the Windows operating system and access level. For example, adversaries may use command-line utilities (e.g., `netsh advfirewall` or PowerShell cmdlets like `Set-NetFirewallProfile`, `New-NetFirewallRule`), Windows Registry modifications (e.g., altering firewall states and rule configurations via registry keys), or the Windows Control Panel to modify firewall settings through the Windows Security interface. By disabling or modifying Windows firewall services, adversaries may enable access to remote services, open ports for command and control traffic, or configure rules for further actions.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.

## Boundary

This lesson is derived from the published technique description. It does not invent an incident, prescribe one implementation, or claim the technique has been addressed.
