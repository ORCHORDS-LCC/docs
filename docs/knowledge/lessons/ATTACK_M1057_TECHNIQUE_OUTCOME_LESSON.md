# M1057 Data Loss Prevention Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **M1057 — Data Loss Prevention**

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) involves implementing strategies and technologies to identify, categorize, monitor, and control the movement of sensitive data within an organization. This includes protecting data formats indicative of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), intellectual property, or financial data from unauthorized access, transmission, or exfiltration. DLP solutions integrate with network, endpoint, and cloud platforms to enforce security policies and prevent accidental or malicious data leaks. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Sensitive Data Categorization: - Use Case: Identify and classify data based on sensitivity (e.g., PII, financial data, trade secrets). - Implementation: Use DLP solutions to scan and tag files containing sensitive information using predefined patterns, such as Social Security Numbers or credit card details. Exfiltration Restrictions: - Use Case: Prevent unauthorized transmission of sensitive data. - Implementation: Enforce policies to block unapproved email attachments, unauthorized USB usage, or unencrypted data uploads to cloud storage. Data-in-Transit Monitoring: - Use Case: Detect and prevent the transmission of sensitive data over unapproved channels. - Implementation: Deploy network-based DLP tools to inspect outbound traffic for sensitive content (e.g., financial records or PII) and block unapproved transmissions. Endpoint Data Protection: - Use Case: Monitor and control sensitive data usage on endpoints. - Implementation: Use endpoint-based DLP agents to block copy-paste actions of sensitive data and unauthorized printing or file sharing. Cloud Data Security: - Use Case: Protect data stored in cloud platforms. - Implementation: Integrate DLP with cloud storage platforms like Google Drive, OneDrive, or AWS to monitor and restrict sensitive data sharing or downloads.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.
