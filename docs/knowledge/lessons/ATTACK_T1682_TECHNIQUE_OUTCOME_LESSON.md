# T1682 Query Public AI Services Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **T1682 — Query Public AI Services**
- Tactics: reconnaissance
- Platforms: PRE

Adversaries may query publicly accessible artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as large language models (LLMs), to support targeting and operations. In addition to searching websites or databases directly (i.e., Search Open Websites/Domains), adversaries may use AI services to synthesize, aggregate, and analyze publicly available information at scale. This may include identifying individuals or organizations to target, researching organizational structures and personnel, identifying technologies used by target organizations, researching business relationships to develop plausible pretexts for Social Engineering approaches, identifying contact information for use in Phishing or Phishing for Information, or gathering derogatory or sensitive information about individuals that may be used for extortion or coercion. Information gathered through AI services may be leveraged for other behaviors, such as establishing operational resources (i.e., Generate Content or Establish Accounts. For obtaining access to AI tools and services, see Artificial Intelligence.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.
