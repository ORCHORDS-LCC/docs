# T1057 Process Discovery Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **T1057 — Process Discovery**
- Tactics: discovery
- Platforms: ESXi, Linux, macOS, Network Devices, Windows

Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a system. Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software/applications running on systems within the network. Administrator or otherwise elevated access may provide better process details. Adversaries may use the information from Process Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions. In Windows environments, adversaries could obtain details on running processes using the Tasklist utility via cmd or Get-Process via PowerShell. Information about processes can also be extracted from the output of Native API calls such as CreateToolhelp32Snapshot. In Mac and Linux, this is accomplished with the ps command. Adversaries may also opt to enumerate processes via `/proc`. ESXi also supports use of the `ps` command, as well as `esxcli system process list`. On network devices, Network Device CLI commands such as `show processes` can be used to display current running processes.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.

## Boundary

This lesson is derived from the published technique description. It does not invent an incident, prescribe one implementation, or claim the technique has been addressed.
