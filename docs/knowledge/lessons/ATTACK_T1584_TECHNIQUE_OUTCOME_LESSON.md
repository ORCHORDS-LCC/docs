# T1584 Compromise Infrastructure Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **T1584 — Compromise Infrastructure**
- Tactics: resource-development
- Platforms: PRE

Adversaries may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, network devices, and third-party web and DNS services. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary lifecycle. Additionally, adversaries may compromise numerous machines to form a botnet they can leverage. Use of compromised infrastructure allows adversaries to stage, launch, and execute operations. Compromised infrastructure can help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact with high reputation or trusted sites. For example, adversaries may leverage compromised infrastructure (potentially also in conjunction with Digital Certificates) to further blend in and support staged information gathering and/or Phishing campaigns. Adversaries may also compromise numerous machines to support Proxy and/or proxyware services or to form a botnet. Additionally, adversaries may compromise infrastructure residing in close proximity to a target in order to gain Initial Access via Wi-Fi Networks. By using compromised infrastructure, adversaries may enable follow-on malicious operations. Prior to targeting, adversaries may also compromise the infrastructure of other adversaries.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.
