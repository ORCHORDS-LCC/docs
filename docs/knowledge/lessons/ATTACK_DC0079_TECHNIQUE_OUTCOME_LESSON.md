# DC0079 Driver Load Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **DC0079 — Driver Load**

The process of attaching a driver, which is a software component that allows the operating system and applications to interact with hardware devices, to either user-mode or kernel-mode of a system. This can include benign actions (e.g., hardware drivers) or malicious behavior (e.g., rootkits or unsigned drivers). Examples: - Legitimate Driver Loading: A new graphics driver from a vendor like NVIDIA or AMD is loaded into the system. - Unsigned Driver Loading: A driver without a valid digital signature is loaded into the kernel. - Rootkit Installation: A malicious rootkit driver is loaded to manipulate kernel-mode processes. - Anti-Virus or EDR Driver Loading: An Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution loads its driver to monitor system activities. - Driver Misuse: A legitimate driver is loaded and exploited to execute malicious actions, such as using vulnerable drivers for bypassing defenses (e.g., Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks).

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.
