# AN0021 Analytic 0021 Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **AN0021 — Analytic 0021**
- Platforms: Windows

Adversary manipulates dependencies/dev tools used by developers or CI: a package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm, pip/pipenv, nuget/dotnet, chocolatey/winget, maven/gradle) or a compiler/IDE downloads or restores content; files are written under project paths and execution paths (node_modules, packages, .nuget, .gradle, .m2, %AppData%\npm, %UserProfile%\.cargo\bin, temp build dirs). First run of newly written components triggers scripts (preinstall/postinstall), shell/PowerShell spawning, or loader DLLs, followed by network egress to non-approved registries/CDNs.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.

This lesson is derived from the published technique description. It does not invent an incident, prescribe one implementation, or claim the technique has been addressed.
