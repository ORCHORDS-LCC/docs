# AN0785 Analytic 0785 Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **AN0785 — Analytic 0785**
- Platforms: Windows

Detection focuses on identifying anomalous regsvr32.exe executions that deviate from normal administrative or system use. Defenders may observe regsvr32.exe loading scriptlets or DLLs from unusual paths (especially temporary directories or remote URLs), command-line arguments invoking /i or /u with suspicious file references, network connections initiated by regsvr32.exe, and unsigned or untrusted DLLs being loaded shortly after regsvr32.exe invocation. Correlated sequences include regsvr32.exe process creation, module load of DLL/scriptlet, and optional outbound network traffic.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.

## Boundary

This lesson is derived from the published technique description. It does not invent an incident, prescribe one implementation, or claim the technique has been addressed.
