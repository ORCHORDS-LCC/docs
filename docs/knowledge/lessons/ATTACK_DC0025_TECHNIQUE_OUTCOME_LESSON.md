# DC0025 Cloud Storage Access Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **DC0025 — Cloud Storage Access**

Cloud storage access refers to the retrieval or interaction with data stored in cloud infrastructure. This data component includes activities such as reading, downloading, or accessing files and objects within cloud storage systems. Common examples include API calls like GetObject in AWS S3, which retrieves objects from cloud buckets. Examples: - AWS S3 Access: An adversary uses the `GetObject` API to retrieve sensitive data from an AWS S3 bucket. - Azure Blob Storage Access: A user accesses a blob in Azure Storage using `Get Blob` or `Get Blob Properties`. - Google Cloud Storage Access: An adversary uses `storage.objects.get` to download objects from - OpenStack Swift Storage Access: A user retrieves an object from OpenStack Swift using the `GET` method.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.
