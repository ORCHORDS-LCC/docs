# DC0052 Social Media Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **DC0052 — Social Media**

Established, compromised, or otherwise acquired by adversaries to conduct reconnaissance, influence operations, social engineering, or other cyber threats. *Data Collection Measures:* - API Monitoring - Social media APIs (e.g., Twitter API, Facebook Graph API) can extract behavioral patterns of accounts. - Web Scraping - Extracts public profile data, friend lists, or interactions to identify impersonation attempts. - Threat Intelligence Feeds - External feeds track malicious personas linked to disinformation campaigns or phishing. - OSINT Tools - Maltego, SpiderFoot, and OpenCTI can map social media persona relationships. - Endpoint Detection - EDR logs user behavior and alerts on suspicious social media interactions. - SIEM Logging - Detects access to known phishing pages or social media abuse via proxy logs. - Dark Web Monitoring - Identifies compromised social media credentials being sold.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.
