# T1114.001 Local Email Collection Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **T1114.001 — Local Email Collection**
- Tactics: collection
- Platforms: Windows

Adversaries may target user email on local systems to collect sensitive information. Files containing email data can be acquired from a user’s local system, such as Outlook storage or cache files. Outlook stores data locally in offline data files with an extension of .ost. Outlook 2010 and later supports .ost file sizes up to 50GB, while earlier versions of Outlook support up to 20GB. IMAP accounts in Outlook 2013 (and earlier) and POP accounts use Outlook Data Files (.pst) as opposed to .ost, whereas IMAP accounts in Outlook 2016 (and later) use .ost files. Both types of Outlook data files are typically stored in `(a user home directory)Documents\Outlook Files` or `(a user home directory)AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook`.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.
