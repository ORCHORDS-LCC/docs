# DC0026 Image Deletion Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **DC0026 — Image Deletion**

Removal of a virtual machine image in a cloud infrastructure (ex: Azure Compute Service Images DELETE) Examples: - Azure Compute Service Image Deletion - Example: Deleting a virtual machine image using Azure CLI: `az image delete --name MyImage --resource-group MyResourceGroup` - AWS EC2 AMI (Amazon Machine Image) Deletion - Example: Deregistering an AMI in AWS: `aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-1234567890abcdef0` - Google Cloud Compute Engine Image Deletion - Example: Deleting a custom image in Google Cloud: `gcloud compute images delete my-custom-image` - VMware vSphere - Example: Deleting a VM image/template from a vSphere environment: This data component can be collected through the following measures: Enable Cloud Platform Logging - Azure: Enable "Activity Logs" to capture DELETE requests to `Microsoft.Compute/images`. - AWS: Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor `DeregisterImage` or `DeleteSnapshot` API calls. - Google Cloud: Enable "Cloud Audit Logs" to track image deletion events under `compute.googleapis.com/images`. API Monitoring - Monitor API activity to track the deletion of images using: - AWS SDK/CLI `DeregisterImage` or `DeleteSnapshot`. - Azure REST API DELETE operations for images. - Google Cloud Compute Engine APIs for image deletion. Cloud SIEM Integration - Ingest logs into a centralized SIEM platform for monitoring and alerting: Event Correlation - Correlate image deletion events with unusual account activity or concurrent unauthorized operations.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.
