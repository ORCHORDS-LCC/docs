# DC0060 Service Creation Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **DC0060 — Service Creation**

The registration of a new service or daemon on an operating system. *Data Collection Measures:* - Windows Event Logs - Event ID 4697 - Captures the creation of a new Windows service. - Event ID 7045 - Captures services installed by administrators or adversaries. - Event ID 7034 - Could indicate malicious service modification or exploitation. - Sysmon Logs - Sysmon Event ID 1 - Process Creation (captures service executables). - Sysmon Event ID 4 - Service state changes (detects service installation). - Sysmon Event ID 13 - Registry modifications (captures service persistence changes). - PowerShell Logging - Monitor `New-Service` and `Set-Service` PowerShell cmdlets in Event ID 4104 (Script Block Logging). - Linux/macOS Collection Methods - AuditD & Syslog Daemon Logs (`/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/daemon.log`) - AuditD Rules: - `auditctl -w /etc/systemd/system -p wa -k service_creation` - Detects changes to `systemd` service configurations. - Systemd Journals (`journalctl -u <service_name>`) - Captures newly created systemd services. - LaunchDaemons & LaunchAgents (macOS) - Monitor `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` and `/Library/LaunchAgents/` for new plist files.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.
