# DC0089 Instance Stop Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **DC0089 — Instance Stop**

The deactivation or shutdown of a virtual machine instance within a cloud infrastructure. This action typically involves stopping a running instance, which halts its operation and releases certain associated resources, such as CPU and memory. Examples: - Google Cloud Platform (GCP): `instance.stop` events recorded in GCP Audit Logs indicate the deactivation of an instance. - Amazon Web Services (AWS): `StopInstances` actions in AWS CloudTrail indicate EC2 instances being stopped. - Microsoft Azure: `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/deallocate` or `stop` events in Azure Activity Logs represent a virtual machine being stopped or deallocated.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.
