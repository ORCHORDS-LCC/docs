# T1021 Remote Services Outcome Lesson

## Authoritative description

- Technique: **T1021 — Remote Services**
- Tactics: lateral-movement
- Platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows, IaaS, ESXi

Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to log into a service that accepts remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and VNC. The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user. In an enterprise environment, servers and workstations can be organized into domains. Domains provide centralized identity management, allowing users to login using one set of credentials across the entire network. If an adversary is able to obtain a set of valid domain credentials, they could login to many different machines using remote access protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP). They could also login to accessible SaaS or IaaS services, such as those that federate their identities to the domain, or management platforms for internal virtualization environments such as VMware vCenter. Legitimate applications (such as Software Deployment Tools and other administrative programs) may utilize Remote Services to access remote hosts. For example, Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) on macOS is native software used for remote management. ARD leverages a blend of protocols, including VNC to send the screen and control buffers and SSH for secure file transfer. Adversaries can abuse applications such as ARD to gain remote code execution and perform lateral movement. In versions of macOS prior to 10.14, an adversary can escalate an SSH session to an ARD session which enables an adversary to accept TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) prompts without user interaction and gain access to data.

## Reusable lesson

This technique should be treated as an explicit review question when it is relevant to the system or organisation, rather than assumed to be covered by a generic control statement or by tooling that reports a related signal.

## Apply the lesson

1. Define the real scope before judging coverage.
2. Inspect current technical, process, governance, or operational evidence.
3. Separate documented intent from verified behaviour.
4. Record partial coverage and unresolved gaps instead of converting them into a pass.
5. Revisit when the underlying scope, threat environment, technology, suppliers, or mission materially changes.
