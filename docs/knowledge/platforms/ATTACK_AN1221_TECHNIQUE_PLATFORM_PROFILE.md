# Analytic 1221 Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1221 — Analytic 1221**
- Platforms named in the source: Windows

Detects the creation, modification, or deletion of scheduled tasks through Task Scheduler, WMI, PowerShell, or API-based methods followed by execution from svchost.exe or taskeng.exe. Includes detection of hidden or anomalous scheduled tasks, especially those created under SYSTEM or suspicious user contexts.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
