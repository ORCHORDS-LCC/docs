# Analytic 0065 Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0065 — Analytic 0065**
- Platforms named in the source: Windows

Adversary stages a lure that references a remote resource (e.g., LNK/SCF/Office template). When the user opens/renders the file or a shell enumerates icons, the host automatically attempts SMB or WebDAV authentication to the attacker host. The chain is: (1) lure file is created or modified in a user-exposed location → (2) user or system accesses the lure → (3) host makes outbound NTLM (SMB 139/445 or WebDAV over 80/443) to an untrusted destination → (4) repeated attempts from multiple users/hosts or from privileged workstations.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
