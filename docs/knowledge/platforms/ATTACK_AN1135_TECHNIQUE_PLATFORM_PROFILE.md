# Analytic 1135 Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1135 — Analytic 1135**
- Platforms named in the source: Linux

Abuse of extended attributes (xattrs) to embed hidden payloads into legitimate files. Defender perspective: detect anomalous use of setfattr or getfattr commands, or direct syscalls (setxattr, getxattr) where attributes are unusually large or contain encoded data. Behavior chain includes: (1) execution of setfattr with suspicious namespaces (user., trusted.), (2) file metadata modification inconsistent with file size/hash, and (3) subsequent process execution reading attributes followed by decoding activity.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
