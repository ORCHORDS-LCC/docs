# Analytic 0435 Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0435 — Analytic 0435**
- Platforms named in the source: macOS

Detection focuses on adversaries placing or modifying malicious dylibs in locations searched by legitimate applications. From the defender’s perspective, observable patterns include unexpected creation or modification of dylib files in application bundle paths, unusual module loads by processes compared to historical baselines, and execution of applications loading dylibs from suspicious directories (e.g., /tmp, user-controlled paths). Correlation across file system changes, process execution, and module loads provides high-fidelity detection.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
