# Privileged Process Integrity Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **M1025 — Privileged Process Integrity**
- Platforms named in the source: not stated

Privileged Process Integrity focuses on defending highly privileged processes (e.g., system services, antivirus, or authentication processes) from tampering, injection, or compromise by adversaries. These processes often interact with critical components, making them prime targets for techniques like code injection, privilege escalation, and process manipulation. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Protected Process Mechanisms: - Enable RunAsPPL on Windows systems to protect LSASS and other critical processes. - Use registry modifications to enforce protected process settings: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RunAsPPL` Anti-Injection and Memory Protection: - Enable Control Flow Guard (CFG), DEP, and ASLR to protect against process memory tampering. - Deploy endpoint protection tools that actively block process injection attempts. Code Signing Validation: - Implement policies for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) or AppLocker to enforce execution of signed binaries. - Ensure critical processes are signed with valid certificates. Access Controls: - Use DACLs and MIC to limit which users and processes can interact with privileged processes. - Disable unnecessary debugging capabilities for high-privileged processes. Kernel-Level Protections: - Ensure Kernel Patch Protection (PatchGuard) is enabled on Windows systems. - Leverage SELinux or AppArmor on Linux to enforce kernel-level security policies. *Tools for Implementation* Protected Process Light (PPL): - RunAsPPL (Windows) - Windows Defender Credential Guard Code Integrity and Signing: - Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) - AppLocker - SELinux/AppArmor (Linux) Memory Protection: - Control Flow Guard (CFG), Data Execution Prevention (DEP), ASLR Process Isolation/Sandboxing: - Firejail (Linux Sandbox) - Windows Sandbox - QEMU/KVM-based isolation Kernel Protection: - PatchGuard (Windows Kernel Patch Protection) - SELinux (Mandatory Access Control for Linux) - AppArmor.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
