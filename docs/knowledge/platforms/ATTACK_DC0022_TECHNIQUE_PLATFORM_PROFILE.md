# Cloud Storage Deletion Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0022 — Cloud Storage Deletion**
- Platforms named in the source: not stated

Cloud Storage Deletion refers to the removal or destruction of cloud storage infrastructure, such as buckets, containers, or directories, within a cloud environment. Monitoring this activity is critical to detecting potential unauthorized or malicious actions, such as data destruction by adversaries or accidental deletions that may lead to data loss. Examples: - AWS S3 Bucket Deletion: An AWS user deletes an S3 bucket using the `DeleteBucket` API call. - Azure Blob Storage Container Deletion: A user deletes a container in Azure Blob Storage using the `Delete Container` operation. - Google Cloud Storage Bucket Deletion: A Google Cloud user deletes a bucket using the `storage.buckets.delete` API. - OpenStack Swift Container Deletion: A user deletes a container in OpenStack Swift using the `DELETE` method. This data component can be collected through the following measures: Enable Logging for Cloud Storage Services - AWS S3: Enable AWS CloudTrail to log DeleteBucket API actions. - Azure Blob Storage: Enable Azure Monitor and Diagnostic Logs to capture Delete Container operations. Use Azure Event Grid to capture and trigger alerts for container deletion. - Google Cloud Storage: Enable Data Access logs in Cloud Audit Logs to monitor storage.buckets.delete API calls. - OpenStack Swift: Configure Swift logging to capture DELETE requests for containers. Centralized Logging and Analysis - Use platforms like Splunk or native SIEMs to forward and analyze logs for anomalies in cloud storage deletions.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
