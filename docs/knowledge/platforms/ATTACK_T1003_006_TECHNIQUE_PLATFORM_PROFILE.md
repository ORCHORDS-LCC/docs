# DCSync Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **T1003.006 — DCSync**
- Platforms named in the source: Windows

Adversaries may attempt to access credentials and other sensitive information by abusing a Windows Domain Controller's application programming interface (API) to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller using a technique called DCSync. Members of the Administrators, Domain Admins, and Enterprise Admin groups or computer accounts on the domain controller are able to run DCSync to pull password data from Active Directory, which may include current and historical hashes of potentially useful accounts such as KRBTGT and Administrators. The hashes can then in turn be used to create a Golden Ticket for use in Pass the Ticket or change an account's password as noted in Account Manipulation. DCSync functionality has been included in the "lsadump" module in Mimikatz. Lsadump also includes NetSync, which performs DCSync over a legacy replication protocol.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
