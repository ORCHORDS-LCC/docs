# Analytic 0465 Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0465 — Analytic 0465**
- Platforms named in the source: Network Devices

Defenders may observe unauthorized or anomalous changes to NAT configurations, including the addition of new translation rules or modifications to existing ones. Suspicious behaviors include sudden introduction of NAT mappings bridging segmented networks, new port address translation rules that obscure true source IPs, or traffic flows inconsistent with expected network design. Multi-event correlation includes detecting configuration changes on routers/firewalls, followed by traffic traversing unexpected internal/external address pairs.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
