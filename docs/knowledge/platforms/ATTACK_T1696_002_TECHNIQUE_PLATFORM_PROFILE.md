# Avoid CAPTCHA Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **T1696.002 — Avoid CAPTCHA**
- Platforms named in the source: SaaS

Adversaries may avoid CAPTCHA challenges by mimicking human behavior. Automation tests, such as CAPTCHA, are typically used by defenders to detect and prevent bot and spam traffic from accessing protected webpages. CAPTCHAs are often placed before login screens or form fields. Traditional CAPTCHAs ask the user to decipher a string of characters, type the characters into a box, and submit the form. reCAPTCHA asks the user to identify images, click a checkbox, or evaluate the user’s behavior from mouse movement and device cookies. Adversaries may attempt to avoid CAPTCHA challenges by constructing a bot that mimics human behavior through browser automation. The automated browser may mimic a human by Masquerading a Browser Fingerprint and through attributes such as session history, IP reputation, and the use of browser APIs. For example, adversaries may use Selenium browsers to simulate a human user. In the Selenium browsers, JavaScript is injected into the website’s Document Object Model (DOM). The injected script may modify browser attributes such as Audio Context and Voice engines, graphic rendering, installed fonts, and browser navigator objects.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
