# Analytic 1029 Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1029 — Analytic 1029**
- Platforms named in the source: Windows

Detection of AppCert DLL abuse involves correlating registry modifications to the AppCertDLLs key with subsequent unexpected DLL load behavior during process creation events. Specifically, defenders can observe abnormal DLLs being loaded into standard Windows processes after changes to the 'AppCertDLLs' registry value. Monitoring CreateProcess-family API executions with injected DLLs and linking those DLLs back to recent registry edits is key to identifying misuse. This is often accompanied by elevated privileges and potential lateral movement or discovery behavior.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
