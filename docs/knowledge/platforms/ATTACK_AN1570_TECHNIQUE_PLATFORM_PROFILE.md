# Analytic 1570 Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1570 — Analytic 1570**
- Platforms named in the source: Network Devices

Defenders may observe adversary attempts to downgrade system images by monitoring for anomalous file transfers of OS image files (via TFTP, FTP, SCP), configuration changes pointing boot system variables to older image files, unexpected OS version strings after reboot, and checksum mismatches against approved baseline images. Suspicious chains include transfer of an older image, alteration of boot configuration, and reboot/reload of the device. Adversaries may also tamper with CLI output to disguise downgrade attempts, requiring independent validation of OS version and integrity.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
