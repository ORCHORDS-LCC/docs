# Gatekeeper Bypass Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **T1144 — Gatekeeper Bypass**
- Platforms named in the source: macOS

In macOS and OS X, when applications or programs are downloaded from the internet, there is a special attribute set on the file called com.apple.quarantine. This attribute is read by Apple's Gatekeeper defense program at execution time and provides a prompt to the user to allow or deny execution. Apps loaded onto the system from USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, or even from a drive shared over the local network won’t set this flag. Additionally, other utilities or events like drive-by downloads don’t necessarily set it either. This completely bypasses the built-in Gatekeeper check. The presence of the quarantine flag can be checked by the xattr command xattr /path/to/MyApp.app for com.apple.quarantine. Similarly, given sudo access or elevated permission, this attribute can be removed with xattr as well, sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/MyApp.app. In typical operation, a file will be downloaded from the internet and given a quarantine flag before being saved to disk. When the user tries to open the file or application, macOS’s gatekeeper will step in and check for the presence of this flag. If it exists, then macOS will then prompt the user to confirmation that they want to run the program and will even provide the URL where the application came from. However, this is all based on the file being downloaded from a quarantine-savvy application.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
