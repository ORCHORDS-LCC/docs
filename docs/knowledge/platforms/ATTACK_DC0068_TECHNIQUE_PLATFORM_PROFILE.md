# Active Directory Object Deletion Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0068 — Active Directory Object Deletion**
- Platforms named in the source: not stated

Object deletion in AD (e.g., user accounts, groups, OUs) is logged as Event ID 5141. Examples: - User Account: Deleted user. - Group: Deleted security/distribution group. - Organizational Unit (OU): Loss of configurations or policies. - Service Account: Disrupted operations or cover tracks. - Trust Object: Removed domain trust, disrupting connectivity. *Data Collection Measures:* - Audit Policy: - Enable "Audit Directory Service Changes" (Success and Failure). - Path: `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Audit Policies > Directory Service Changes`. - Key Event: Event ID 5141. - Log Forwarding: Use WEF to centralize logs for SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk). - Enable EDR Monitoring: - Detect processes or users that initiate unauthorized object deletions. - Monitor tools and scripts that may delete key directory objects.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
