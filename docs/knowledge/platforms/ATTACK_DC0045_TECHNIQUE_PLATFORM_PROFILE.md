# Windows Registry Key Deletion Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0045 — Windows Registry Key Deletion**
- Platforms named in the source: not stated

The removal of a registry key within the Windows operating system. *Data Collection Measures:* - Windows Event Logs - Event ID 4658 - Registry Key Handle Closed: Captures when a handle to a registry key is closed, which may indicate deletion. - Event ID 4660 - Object Deleted: Logs when a registry key is deleted. - Sysmon (System Monitor) for Windows - Sysmon Event ID 12 - Registry Key Deleted: Logs when a registry key is removed. - Sysmon Event ID 13 - Registry Value Deleted: Captures removal of specific registry values. - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions - Monitor registry deletions for suspicious behavior.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
