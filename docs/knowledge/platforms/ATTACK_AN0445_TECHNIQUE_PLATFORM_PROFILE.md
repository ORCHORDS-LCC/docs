# Analytic 0445 Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0445 — Analytic 0445**
- Platforms named in the source: Windows

Detection of msiexec.exe execution where command-line arguments reference remote MSI packages, UNC paths, HTTP/HTTPS URLs, or DLLs, correlated with subsequent module loads and/or network connections to previously unseen destinations. The behavioral chain links process creation of msiexec.exe with suspicious parameters, network activity to retrieve payloads, and module loading indicative of malicious installation or DLL execution.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
