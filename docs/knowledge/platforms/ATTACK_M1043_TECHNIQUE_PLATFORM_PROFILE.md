# Credential Access Protection Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **M1043 — Credential Access Protection**
- Platforms named in the source: not stated

Credential Access Protection focuses on implementing measures to prevent adversaries from obtaining credentials, such as passwords, hashes, tokens, or keys, that could be used for unauthorized access. This involves restricting access to credential storage mechanisms, hardening configurations to block credential dumping methods, and using monitoring tools to detect suspicious credential-related activity. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Restrict Access to Credential Storage: - Use Case: Prevent adversaries from accessing the SAM (Security Account Manager) database on Windows systems. - Implementation: Enforce least privilege principles and restrict administrative access to credential stores such as `C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM`. Use Credential Guard: - Use Case: Isolate LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) memory to prevent credential dumping. - Implementation: Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard on enterprise endpoints to isolate secrets and protect them from unauthorized access. Monitor for Credential Dumping Tools: - Use Case: Detect and block known tools like Mimikatz or Windows Credential Editor. - Implementation: Flag suspicious process behavior related to credential dumping. Disable Cached Credentials: - Use Case: Prevent adversaries from exploiting cached credentials on endpoints. - Implementation: Configure group policy to reduce or eliminate the use of cached credentials (e.g., set Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache to 0). Enable Secure Boot and Memory Protections: - Use Case: Prevent memory-based attacks used to extract credentials. - Implementation: Configure Secure Boot and enforce hardware-based security features like DEP (Data Execution Prevention) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
