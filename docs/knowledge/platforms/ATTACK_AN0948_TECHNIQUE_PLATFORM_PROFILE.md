# Analytic 0948 Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0948 — Analytic 0948**
- Platforms named in the source: macOS

Detects anomalous use of macOS XPC services for code execution. Monitors for processes invoking privileged XPC daemons with abnormal parameters, unexpected binaries communicating over NSXPCConnection, or helper tools executing code outside of their expected parent process lineage. Correlates process access attempts to system-level daemons, privilege escalations via XPC misconfigurations, and injection of malicious payloads through inter-process communication.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
