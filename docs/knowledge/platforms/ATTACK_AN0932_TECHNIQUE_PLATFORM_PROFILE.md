# Analytic 0932 Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **AN0932 — Analytic 0932**
- Platforms named in the source: Windows

Execution of CMSTP.exe with arguments pointing to suspicious or remote INF/SCT/DLL payloads, optionally followed by outbound network connections to untrusted IPs, process injection via COM interfaces (CMSTPLUA, CMLUAUTIL), registry modifications registering malicious profiles, or creation of suspicious INF/DLL/SCT files prior to execution.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
