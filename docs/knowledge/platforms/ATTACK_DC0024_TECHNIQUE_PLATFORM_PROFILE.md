# Cloud Storage Creation Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0024 — Cloud Storage Creation**
- Platforms named in the source: not stated

Cloud Storage Creation refers to the initial creation of a new cloud storage resource, such as buckets, containers, or directories, within a cloud environment. This action is critical to track as it might indicate the legitimate provisioning of resources or unauthorized actions taken by adversaries to stage, store, or exfiltrate data. Examples: - AWS S3 Bucket Creation: An AWS user creates a new S3 bucket using the `CreateBucket` API call. - Azure Blob Storage Container Creation: A user creates a new container in Azure Blob Storage using the `Create Container` operation. - Google Cloud Storage Bucket Creation: A Google Cloud user creates a new bucket using `storage.buckets.create`. - OpenStack Swift Container Creation: A user creates a new container in OpenStack Swift using the `PUT` method.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
