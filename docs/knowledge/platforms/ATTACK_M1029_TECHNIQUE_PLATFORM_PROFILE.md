# Remote Data Storage Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **M1029 — Remote Data Storage**
- Platforms named in the source: not stated

Remote Data Storage focuses on moving critical data, such as security logs and sensitive files, to secure, off-host locations to minimize unauthorized access, tampering, or destruction by adversaries. By leveraging remote storage solutions, organizations enhance the protection of forensic evidence, sensitive information, and monitoring data. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Centralized Log Management: - Configure endpoints to forward security logs to a centralized log collector or SIEM. - Use tools like Splunk Graylog, or Security Onion to aggregate and store logs. - Example command (Linux): `sudo auditd | tee /var/log/audit/audit.log | nc <remote-log-server> 514` Remote File Storage Solutions: - Utilize cloud storage solutions like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage for sensitive data. - Ensure proper encryption at rest and access control policies (IAM roles, ACLs). Intrusion Detection Log Forwarding: - Forward logs from IDS/IPS systems (e.g., Zeek/Suricata) to a remote security information system. - Example for Suricata log forwarding: `outputs: - type: syslog protocol: tls address: <remote-syslog-server>` Immutable Backup Configurations: - Enable immutable storage settings for backups to prevent adversaries from modifying or deleting data. - Example: AWS S3 Object Lock. Data Encryption: - Ensure encryption for sensitive data using AES-256 at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit. Tools: OpenSSL, BitLocker, LUKS for Linux.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
