# Windows Management Instrumentation Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **T1047 — Windows Management Instrumentation**
- Platforms named in the source: Windows

Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malicious commands and payloads. WMI is designed for programmers and is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows systems. WMI is an administration feature that provides a uniform environment to access Windows system components. The WMI service enables both local and remote access, though the latter is facilitated by Remote Services such as Distributed Component Object Model and Windows Remote Management. Remote WMI over DCOM operates using port 135, whereas WMI over WinRM operates over port 5985 when using HTTP and 5986 for HTTPS. An adversary can use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to execute various behaviors, such as gathering information for Discovery as well as Execution of commands and payloads. For example, `wmic.exe` can be abused by an adversary to delete shadow copies with the command `wmic.exe Shadowcopy Delete` (i.e., Inhibit System Recovery). **Note:** `wmic.exe` is deprecated as of January of 2024, with the WMIC feature being “disabled by default” on Windows 11+. WMIC will be removed from subsequent Windows releases and replaced by PowerShell as the primary WMI interface. In addition to PowerShell and tools like `wbemtool.exe`, COM APIs can also be used to programmatically interact with WMI via C++, .NET, VBScript, etc.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
