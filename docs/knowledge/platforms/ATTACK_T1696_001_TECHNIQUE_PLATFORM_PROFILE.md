# Automate CAPTCHA Completion Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **T1696.001 — Automate CAPTCHA Completion**
- Platforms named in the source: SaaS

Adversaries may attempt to use bots to successfully solve CAPTCHA challenges. CAPTCHA challenges are typically used by defenders to detect and prevent bot and spam traffic from accessing protected webpages. CAPTCHAs are automated tests often placed before login screens or form fields. Traditional CAPTCHAs ask the user to decipher a string of characters, type the characters into a box, and submit the form. reCAPTCHA asks the user to identify images, click a checkbox, or evaluate the user’s behavior from mouse movement and device cookies. Adversaries may use scripts or toolkits to automatically solve the CAPTCHA puzzle. For example, adversaries may develop a script that uses the ImageMagick toolkit to solve the CAPTCHA puzzles to then create multiple valid accounts. ImageMagick tool can convert the images into a RGB complemented image. The CAPTCHA challenge may be solved by identifying and comparing attributes of the RGB images to select the expected image. Once the CAPTCHA challenge is solved, the adversary’s script may access the protected page. After accessing the protected the page, the adversary may submit valid forms to the target.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
