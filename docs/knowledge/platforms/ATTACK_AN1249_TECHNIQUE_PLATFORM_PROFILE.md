# Analytic 1249 Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **AN1249 — Analytic 1249**
- Platforms named in the source: Network Devices

Defenders may observe suspicious SNMP MIB enumeration through abnormal queries for large sets of OIDs, repeated SNMP GETBULK/GETNEXT requests, or queries originating from non-administrative IP addresses. Anomalous use of community strings, authentication failures, or enumeration activity outside maintenance windows may also indicate attempts to dump MIB contents. Correlation across syslog, NetFlow, and SNMP audit data can reveal chains of behavior such as repeated authentication failures followed by successful large-scale OID retrieval.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
