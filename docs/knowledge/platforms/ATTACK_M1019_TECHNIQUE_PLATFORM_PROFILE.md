# Threat Intelligence Program Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **M1019 — Threat Intelligence Program**
- Platforms named in the source: not stated

A Threat Intelligence Program enables organizations to proactively identify, analyze, and act on cyber threats by leveraging internal and external data sources. The program supports decision-making processes, prioritizes defenses, and improves incident response by delivering actionable intelligence tailored to the organization's risk profile and operational environment. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: Establish a Threat Intelligence Team: - Form a dedicated team or assign responsibility to existing security personnel to collect, analyze, and act on threat intelligence. Define Intelligence Requirements: - Identify the organization’s critical assets and focus intelligence gathering efforts on threats targeting these assets. Leverage Internal and External Data Sources: - Collect intelligence from internal sources such as logs, incidents, and alerts. Subscribe to external threat intelligence feeds, participate in ISACs, and monitor open-source intelligence (OSINT). Implement Tools for Automation: - Use threat intelligence platforms (TIPs) to automate the collection, enrichment, and dissemination of threat data. - Integrate threat intelligence with SIEMs to correlate IOCs with internal events. Analyze and Act on Intelligence: - Use frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to map intelligence to adversary TTPs. - Prioritize defensive measures, such as patching vulnerabilities or deploying IOCs, based on analyzed threats. Share and Collaborate: - Share intelligence with industry peers through ISACs or threat-sharing platforms to enhance collective defense. Evaluate and Update the Program: - Regularly assess the effectiveness of the threat intelligence program. - Update intelligence priorities and capabilities as new threats emerge. *Tools for Implementation* Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs): - OpenCTI: An open-source platform for structuring and sharing threat intelligence. - MISP: A threat intelligence sharing platform for sharing structured threat data. Threat Intelligence Feeds: - Open Threat Exchange (OTX): Provides free access to a large repository of threat intelligence. - CIRCL OSINT Feed: A free source for IOCs and threat information. Automation and Enrichment Tools: - TheHive: An open-source incident response platform with threat intelligence integration. - Yeti: A platform for managing and structuring knowledge about threats. Analysis Frameworks: - MITRE ATT&CK Navigator: A tool for mapping threat intelligence to adversary behaviors. - Cuckoo Sandbox: Analyzes malware to extract behavioral indicators. Community and Collaboration Tools: - ISAC Memberships: Join industry-specific ISACs for intelligence sharing. - Slack/Discord Channels: Participate in threat intelligence communities for real-time collaboration.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
