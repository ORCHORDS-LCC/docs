# Group Enumeration Technique Platform Profile

## Reference

- Technique: **DC0099 — Group Enumeration**
- Platforms named in the source: not stated

Extracting group lists from identity systems identifies permissions, roles, or configurations. Adversaries may exploit high-privilege groups or misconfigurations. Examples: - AWS CLI: `aws iam list-groups` - PowerShell: `Get-ADGroup -Filter *` - (Saas) Google Workspace: Admin SDK Directory API - Azure: `Get-AzureADGroup` - Microsoft 365: Graph API `GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups` *Data Collection Measures:* - Cloud Logging: Enable AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, and Google Workspace Admin Logs for group-related actions. - Directory Monitoring: Track logs like AD Event ID 4662 (object operations). - API Monitoring: Log API activity like AWS IAM queries. - SaaS Monitoring: Use platform logs (e.g., Office 365 Unified Audit Logs). - SIEM Integration: Centralize group query tracking.

## Platform profile

1. Record the platforms in scope and the versions actually deployed.
2. Compare the deployed platform surface against the platforms the source names.
3. Record where the platform provides a native control for the technique, and where it does not.
4. Record the configuration evidence for the native control, where one exists.
5. Record the gap where the platform provides no native control, and the compensating detection.
6. Record the platform version, because platform behaviour changes between versions.

## Evidence

- the platform and version inventory for the scoped estate;
- the configuration export or screenshot for the native control;
- the detection evidence where the platform provides none.

## Limitations

A technique entry describes a class of abuse across platforms. The platform-specific exposure is a property of the deployment, established only by inventory and configuration evidence.
